            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

THE whole Treatiſe is ſuch a tedious Rhapſody
of Fictitious, Fallacious Inferences and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
confuſedly mixt with ſome diſtorted
Truths ſpun out to an unneceſſary prodigious length,
that it would be tireſome to the Reader to trace all
the Prevarications, Miſ-Recitals, and Sophiſtry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it. By which the deſign of the Author ſeems
to be not onely to impoſe a falſe belief upon the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-well-meaning
Subjects of thoſe Provinces; but
even upon the Lords States General Themſelves if it
were poſſible.</p>
            <p>Whether we have truly characterized the ſaid
Treatiſe, we ſhall leave to the Judgment of the unbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed
Reader; and have therefore cauſed it to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
after the <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Copy, and Annexed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
And that we may not be guilty of framing
a long Story without Coherence, Verity or Proof, of
which we accuſe the Author; we ſhall in the firſt
place expoſe to publick View and Cenſure true Copies
of thoſe Original Papers which paſſed between the
Commiſſioners of both Companies at <hi>London, Anno</hi>
1685. which will give ſufficient Light and Confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto the Authors prolix and Erroneous Hiſtory of
thoſe Tranſactions concerning the Affairs of <hi>Bantam:</hi>
And ſhall then proceed to detect his willful miſtakes in
other matters, and his ill-grounded Arguments by
which he endeavours to <hi>Honeſt</hi> many Injurious and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
Violations of Right done by the Dutch towards
the Engliſh in <hi>India,</hi> directly contrary to the Articles
of Peace. In all which we do profeſs the moſt Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſincerity, and to write nothing but what we know
to be really true or believe in our Conſciences ſo to be
upon very ſufficient Evidence, without uſing that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

Liberty which Advocates think they may inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently

we ſhall be content may be admitted for the Authors
Indempnity.</p>
            <p>To omit Credentials and Speeches of Ceremony,
it was agreed that the Treaty ſhould be managed in

of <hi>May,</hi> it is impoſſible for the Commiſſioners of

appointed by His Majeſty, Our Soveraign Lord

Adjuſted: It having been already conſented to by the
<hi>High and Mighty</hi> Lords the States General, and the

ſhould be made thereof; as appears by the Anſwer to
the Memorial preſented by Sir <hi>John Chardin</hi> at the
<hi>Hague,</hi> the 21th. of <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1683. And the only
difference then remaining upon that ſubject was, the
manner of the Reſtitution. So that to enter into proof

of that Place, and of His Majeſties Subjects Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion

any knowledge of the Affairs of <hi>India;</hi> That nothing
leſs than the withdrawing of all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Forces from
<hi>Bantam,</hi> and the Territories thereof, belonging to both
or either of the late Kings of <hi>Bantam,</hi> on the 14th. day
of <hi>March,</hi> 1681-82. and the ſurrender of the Fort of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam</hi>
unto His Majeſty undemoliſhed; can prevent the
Dutch from being immediately Maſters of the entire
Trade of <hi>Pepper.</hi> And what fatal conſequences to
His Majeſty and His Kingdoms do depend upon ſuch
their Engroſſing of that Trade, we have Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in Writing to His late Majeſty of Bleſſed Memory:
And the Memorial relating thereunto, now remains in
the hands of the Clerks of His Majeſties Moſt Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Privy Council. And although His late Majeſty did
only demand from the Dutch, the withdrawing of all
their Forces from <hi>Bantam,</hi> &amp;c. and the ſatisfying the
<hi>Eaſt-India-Company</hi> for the dammages ſuſtained, by
reaſon of the unjuſt ſurpriſal thereof; Our later advices
from <hi>India</hi> have given us ſufficient Reaſons to juſtifie
our further Demand of having the Fort of <hi>Bantam</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to His Majeſty undemoliſhed, for the following
Reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe (as we foreſaw when we humbly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
our Memorial aforeſaid to His late Majeſtie.)
The Dutch have ſince not only obſtructed but Hoſtile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
invaded our Trade, and ſhot at our Servants with
Bullets on the Coaſt of <hi>Mallabar,</hi> to deter and beat
them off from that little remainder we had there of the
<hi>Pepper</hi> Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61112:10"/>
2. We ſince underſtand that the Dutch have ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably
enthralled and improveriſhed both the late
Kings of <hi>Bantam,</hi> that they are not now both able to
pay us 5 l. of that vaſt Debt they owe us, otherwiſe
than by that Fort of <hi>Bantam,</hi> which was built with the
Money the young King owed us, and the Guns mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the ſaid Fort are our own Guns, for which we
were never paid.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe the Young King (as we have been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly
informed, and do believe) aſſaſſinated formerly
our Agent and Factors (though for what Cauſe, or
who inſtigated them thereunto we know not.) And
now the Dutch ſay, it was He the ſaid Young King
and not They, that commanded us away from <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam:</hi>
And therefore we dare not without a ſtrong
Garriſon to defend us, truſt our Servants and Eſtates
in his Dominions; neither will any go thither that are
worth ſending, without ſuch ſecurity be provided for
their Lives.</p>
            <p>4. Becauſe if the Old King of <hi>Bantam</hi> had a right
to <hi>Bantam,</hi> and to the Territories thereof. They are
now His Majeſties by His Donation of them to the late
King of ever Bleſſed Memory. If the Right thereof
lyes (as the Dutch ſay) in the Young King, He hath
been ſo inhumane, ungrateful, and bloody an Enemy
to His Majeſties Subjects confeſſedly, without the leaſt
Cauſe or Provocation on their part, that we humbly
conceive His Majeſties Honour cannot be repaired
without invading his City and Countrey: And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe though he be called a King, he is in truth
none, but a perfect Slave to the <hi>Batavians,</hi> and an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner
of their will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>5. If the Dutch ſay the Young King is their Allie,
and they are bound in honour to protect him: We ſay,
by that Rule there can never be Peace between the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61112:10"/>
Engliſh and the Dutch in <hi>India:</hi> And they may be as
good Right eaſily make a Quarrel between any other
<hi>Indian</hi> Princes and their Neighbours, or their own Sons
or Brothers; and then take a ſide; and condition with
the <hi>prevailing</hi> ſide to turn us and all other <hi>Europeans</hi> out
of their Countries, and we muſt not revenge our Selves
becauſe they will protect ſuch injured and injurious
Princes as their Allies: Whereas by the Articles of
Peace, the Engliſh and Dutch ought mutually to aſſiſt
and help each other.</p>
            <p>6. This is an old practice of the Dutch: So they
made a quarrel with the <hi>Macaſſars,</hi> and when the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Princes were equally matched, they aſſiſted one
ſide which turned the ballance, and they conditioned
with the prevailing ſide to turn the Engliſh (<hi>Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim</hi>)
and all other <hi>Europeans</hi> out of their Countrey.</p>
            <p>7. The Dutch were doing the ſame thing again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Kings or <hi>Rajas</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Mallabar,</hi>
when our laſt Letters came from that Coaſt.</p>
            <p>8. If the Dutch ſay, the old King was aſſiſted by the
Engliſh againſt his Son the Young King, and therefore
he turned the Engliſh out of his Countrey: We An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
That that is ſo falſe a ſuggeſtion, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
think the Dutch themſelves believe it: And that it is
as manifeſt as the Sun at noon day, That the Dutch
having beguiled the young King into their power, to
compaſs to themſelves the entire Trade of that place,
compelled him to force the Engliſh out of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
Otherwiſe why did he at the ſame time force
away the <hi>French, Danes, Portuguez, Moguls, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi>
and other Nations againſt whom no ſuch pretence
was or could be made.</p>
            <p>On the whole matter, and out of a true and real
ſence of our bounden Duty and Allegiance to His
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61112:11"/>
Majeſty, and the vaſt Concernment <hi>Bantam</hi> is (not to
us) but to His Majeſties Honour and Intereſt: We
humbly propoſe that this Affair of the Reſtitution may
be fully adjuſted before any Treaty be entred upon
concerning the Dammages ſuſtained by His Majeſties
<hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company; of which notwithſtanding we
herewith preſent your Lordſhips the beſt Accompt
we can, until we receive Copies of thoſe <hi>Batavia</hi>

having on the 10<hi>th</hi> of this Inſtant <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
requeſted before your Lordſhips to have Copies
of what the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi> Company do complain

Company do herewith humbly preſent your
Lordſhips with the Companies juſt complaints, and the
Proofs thereof put into <hi>French</hi> by Sir <hi>John Chardin,</hi>
which moſt of the Witneſſes are in Town ready to
confirm. The ſaid Company do inſiſt upon that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
that was firſt preſented to His Majeſty; (of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61112:13"/>
which the Copy is hereunto annexed) and that (with
His Majeſties leave) the matter of the Reſtitution of
<hi>Bantam</hi> to His Majeſties Subjects, may be firſt diſcuſſed
and adjuſted. It having been already conſented to by
the High and Mighty Lords, the <hi>States General,</hi> and
the <hi>Netherlands Eaſt-India</hi> Company, that Reſtitution
ſhould be made thereof, as appears by their Anſwer
to the Memorial preſented by Sir <hi>John Chardin</hi> at the
<hi>Hague</hi> the 21. <hi>May,</hi> 1683. And although His late
Majeſty upon the humble Petition of His Majeſties
<hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company did formerly only demand from
the <hi>Dutch</hi> the withdrawing of all their Forces from
<hi>Bantam,</hi> and the Territories thereunto belonging, or
which did belong to both, or either of the late Kings
of <hi>Bantam</hi> on the 14<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>March,</hi> 1681-82. And
the ſatisfying the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company for the Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
ſuſtained by reaſon of the unjuſt ſurprizal thereof:
Our later advices from <hi>India</hi> have given us ſufficient
reaſon to juſtify our further demand of ſurrendring
the Fort of <hi>Bantam</hi> undemoliſhed, before any Treaty
be entred upon concerning the particular Damages
ſuſtained by the Company: For which increaſe of our
Demands we humbly offer to your Lordſhips the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Eight of theſe Reaſons were the ſame as in the
foregoing Paper of the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> with this Addition.</p>
            <p>9ly. We are well aſſured, and hope to produce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
proofs to your Lordſhips, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> of
<hi>Batavia</hi> ſince they betrayed the young King of <hi>Bantam</hi>
into their Power, have compelled him to sign Articles
in prejudice of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and agreeable to
thoſe in print which they made with the King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſar;</hi>
the buſineſs of <hi>Bantam</hi> being but exactly the
ſame Game played over again iutirely, which they
formerly acted at <hi>Macaſſar;</hi> and may do as many
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61112:13"/>
times more as they pleaſe: And we have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
will, till they are poſſeſſed of all the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Trade excluſive to the other <hi>European</hi> Nations, if
they be not forced by his Majeſty out of that Plea, by
compelling them to make a juſt Reſtitution of <hi>Bantam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although we humbly conceive the notoriety of
the Fact at <hi>Bantam,</hi> is ſufficient to convince all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Judges of the Juſtice of our Complaint and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
and that to add any further proofs to thoſe

was forced to go aſhore for a Boat load of Water,
where I was Spectator of what I was told by the
Factors: The young King hearing of my being aſhore,
would have ſpoke with me, but he that was Chief of
the <hi>Dutch</hi> would not permit him; ſo that the young

any Agent but a Madman and a Fool, he had never

            <p>I Hada houſe in <hi>Bantam</hi> which had been in poſſeſſion

a ſilk Flagg, commonly called <hi>St. George</hi>'s Flagg; which

the houſe, nor any thing therein; and ſo took
out my Goods being Houſhold Goods, four cheſts of

Received by the Emoy Merchant, Dated from

from Mr. Charles Sweeting's of the 17th. ditto,
with the ſaid Sweeting's Depoſition thereupon.</head>
            <p>1. THat upon a difference depending, and a War
broken out, between the old <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Bantam</hi>
and the Young <hi>Sultan</hi> his Son; the Dutch Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>Batavia</hi> pretending to aſſiſt the Young King,
came with a Fleet of Ships and Prows, and attempted
to Land at <hi>Bantam,</hi> on the 14th. of <hi>March</hi> 1681-82. but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61112:18"/>
were beaten off by the Old Kings Forces, and forced
to retreat with their Fleet to a greater diſtance from
the Town, till further recruits might be had from <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via;</hi>
which arriving the 23th. of the ſame month of
<hi>March;</hi> The Dutch General (the ſieur <hi>Martin</hi>) Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Men at <hi>Bantam</hi> the 28th. who forced their way
through the Old Kings Guards, which were placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Caſtle (in which the Young King was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
by His Father) and the ſhoar, and were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
let in by the Young King into the Caſtle, where
they ſet up their Dutch colours, and ſo they did upon
all other principal parts of the Town.</p>
            <p>2. The next day being the 29th. the ſieur <hi>Caeffe</hi> the
Dutch Reſident, with a File of Soldiers and ſeveral
Carpenters, came into the back yard of the Engliſh
Factory, and commanded the Engliſh Agent to pull
down the Balconies, and to nail up all the windows; a
Dutchman in his Company adding by way of threat,
that if the Factory did not cauſe it immediately to be
done, he would himſelf do it; and he accordingly did
cauſe it immediately to be done.</p>
            <p>3. The next day but one being the laſt day of the
month of <hi>March,</hi> 1682. One of the Young Kings
chief Officers called <hi>Pengran Deepa Paneratt,</hi> came to
the Engliſh Factory with a Paper Writ in the <hi>Mallay</hi>
Language, and ſaid to be ſent from the King, being
an Order to the Engliſh with all poſſible ſpeed to get
their Goods and Effects on Board their ſhips and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
his Countrey: The ſaid <hi>Pengran</hi> urged the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Agent and Factors to comply ſpeedily with the
ſaid Order, as they tendred the ſaid Kings diſpleaſure,
But the Engliſh Agent and Factors are aſſured that
no ſuch Order was given voluntarily by the King; the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61112:18"/>
Agent and Council when they were the day before to
attend the King (to repreſent to him how they had
been perfectly Neuters in the differences between him
and the King His Father, and had given him no cauſe
at all to be offended with them,) having perceived no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by his words or actions towards them, of any
intent in him to drive the Engliſh out of his Countrey.
And it is certain there was a great diſpute between
the Young King and the Dutch Major, before he
could be brought to give any ſuch Order, but being
himſelf under the power of the Dutch he was forced
to do it.</p>
            <p>4. When the Engliſh ſaw themſelves in ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and not only their Houſes and other Goods on
ſhoer forcibly taken from them, but their <hi>Powder</hi> alſo
from on Board their ſhips, commanded to ſhore; (as
was done out of the ſhip <hi>Return</hi> on the 3d. of <hi>April,</hi>)
they Laded what Goods and Effects they could in that
hurry get together, in the Countrey Boats, in Order to
put them on Board the Engliſh ſhips then near at hand.
Whilſt this was doing they met with no hindrance
from the Young Kings ſubjects or ſouldiers that were
on ſhoar; but when they came up to the Dutch Guards
at Sea, they were ſtopped and told that they (the
Guards) were ordered not to ſuffer any Goods to be
brought from the ſhoar to the Engliſh ſhips, and that
if the Engliſh did attempt further, to get on Board
their ſhips, they would fire upon them; upon which
the Engliſh and their Boats were forced to return
back.</p>
            <p>5. Of this the Engliſh made their complaint to the
Dutch Major; who in a ſmiling manner told them, all
was by Order of the Young King, (though none of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61112:19"/>
Natives, or the Kings ſoldiers, had any hand in theſe
violences; all being directed by Dutch Officers, and
executed by Dutch ſoldiers. And this is the more
notorious, in that the Young King himſelf told the
French Chief in the preſence of the Dutch <hi>Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
(when the ſaid Chief addreſſed himſelf to him to
have four cheſts of Treaſure, that had been taken from
him reſtored;) That he (the ſaid King) knew nothing
of the cauſe of his complaint; for that he neither had
nor would prejudice him, nor the Engliſh, nor the
<hi>Danes,</hi> nor any other Strangers that were Trading in
His Countrey: Therefore if he (the <hi>French Cheif</hi>)
had any wrong done him ſince the Landing of the
Dutch at <hi>Bantam,</hi> (the King told him) he muſt apply
himſelf to the ſaid Dutch <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> or to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
at <hi>Batavia,</hi> for Reparation.</p>
            <p>6. On the 11th. of <hi>April</hi> the Dutch ſouldiers ent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and ran-ſackt all the Chambers in the Engliſh Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
carrying away whatſoever they found there;
but the <hi>Java</hi>'s (that is the Natives) did not deal ſo
unjuſtly with them, permitting the Factors to ſeal the
Companies Warehouſes, and promiſing to ſecure
them.</p>
            <p>7. On the 12th. of <hi>April</hi> the Engliſh left <hi>Bantam;</hi>
and to ſave themſelves, and what they could of their
Maſters Goods and Effects, imbarqued upon their
ſhips; leaving the Engliſh Flag (commonly called St.
<hi>George</hi>'s Flag) flying upon the Factory where it had
ſtood for ſo many years before; but this Flag was
ſoon taken down by the Dutch, and their Flag ſet up
in the ſtead of it; and ſo had another Flag of St.
<hi>George</hi>'s ſet up upon another Houſe in <hi>Bantam,</hi> being
pulled down by One <hi>Jacob de Roy</hi> Leiutenant of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61112:19"/>
aforeſaid Majors Company, on the 29th. of <hi>March,</hi>
(that was the very next day after the Dutch Landed
there.) And the ſaid Flag being taken down was by
the ſaid <hi>de Roy,</hi> with his own hands torn in pieces,
and given among the ſouldiers to wear for Scarffs.</p>

did upon all other principal parts of the Town.</p>
            <p>2. The next day being the 29<hi>th,</hi> the Seignior <hi>Caeffe,</hi>
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Reſident, with a File of Soldiers, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Workmen, came on the back ſide of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Factory, and commanded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Agent to pull
down the Balconyes, and to nail up all the Windows
looking that way: An Officer in his Company adding
by way of Threat, that if the Factory did not cauſe
it immediately to be done, he would himſelf do it; and
it was cauſed immediately to be done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:61112:20"/>
3. The next day but one, the laſt day of the Month
of <hi>March,</hi> 1682. One of the young Kings Chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
called <hi>Pengran Deepa Panneratt,</hi> came to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Factory, with a Paper writ in the <hi>Mallay</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and ſaid to be ſent from the King, being an Order
to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with all poſſible ſpeed, to be gone with
their Effects aboard their Ships; the ſaid <hi>Pengran</hi> ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Agent and Factors to comply ſpeedily
with the ſaid Order, as they tendred their own Lives,
and the King's Diſpleaſure: But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factors
are aſſured, that the King uſed to put his Seal to all
Orders ſent to them, and to that ſaid Paper was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hand nor Seal: And the Agent and Council when
they were the day before to attend the King, (to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
to him how they had been perfectly Neuters
in the difference between him, and the King his Father;
and had given him no cauſe at all to be offended with
them:) Having perceived nothing by his Words or
Actions towards them, of any intent in him, to drive the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> out of his Country; but on the contrary, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in preſence of ſeveral <hi>Dutch</hi> Officers, that he
alwayes did and would ſtill believe, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
were his Friends: And it is certain, that after the ſaid
Paper was brought to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory, that the
Council could have no admittance to the King, though
ſeveral times they went into the Caſtle, and deſired
leave of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commiſſioners.</p>
            <p>4. When the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſaw themſelves in much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
eſpecially when ſome of their Officers made it
their buſineſs to ſuborn Witneſſes, as was told the
Factors by the very Perſons that they endeavoured to
corrupt, and that a <hi>Dutch</hi> Lieutenant with a File of
Soldiers ſealed up a <hi>Warehouſe</hi> in the Factory; and not
only their Horſes and other Goods on ſhoar forcibly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61112:21"/>
taken from them, but their Powder alſo from on board
their Ships commanded to ſhoar (as was done out of
the Ship <hi>Return</hi> on the 3<hi>d April.</hi>) They loaded what
Goods and Effects they could in that hurry get toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in the Companies Boats, in order to put them on
board the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships then in <hi>Bantam</hi> Road. Whileſt
this was doing they met with no hindrance from the
young King's Subjects or Soldiers; but when they
came up to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards at the Mouth of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
they were ſtopt, and told that the Guards were
ordered not to ſuffer any Goods to be brought from the
ſhoar to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, and that if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men
in the ſaid Boats did attempt further to get on Board
their Ships, they would fire upon them: Upon which the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and their Boats returned to the Factory Gate.</p>
            <p>5. Of this the <hi>Engliſh</hi> made their complaint to the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Commiſſioners, who told them, all was by
Order of the King; though none of the Natives, or
the King's Soldiers appeared (to the knowledge of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi>) in theſe violences, all being executed by <hi>Dutch</hi>
Soldiers. And this is the more notorious, in that the
young King himſelf told the <hi>French</hi> Chief, (as the ſaid
Chief acquainted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factors) that in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commiſſioners, when the ſaid
Chief addreſſed to him to have ſome Cheſts of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
reſtored, that had been taken from him; That
he the ſaid King knew nothing of the Cauſe of his
Complaint, and that he neither had nor would preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
him; nor the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor the <hi>Danes,</hi> nor any
other Strangers that were Trading in his Country.
Therefore if he (the ſaid Chief) had any wrong done
him ſince the landing of the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Bantam,</hi> the
King told him he muſt apply himſelf to the ſaid <hi>Dutch</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61112:21"/>
Commiſſioners or to the General of <hi>Batavia</hi> for Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>6. On the 11<hi>th April,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers entred
and ranſackt all the Chambers of the young men in
the Factory; but the <hi>Javaes</hi> (that is, the Natives) did
not deal ſo with them; they permitting the Factors
to ſeal the Companies Warehouſes, and promiſing to
ſecure them.</p>

            <head>The Relation and Depoſition of Ambroſe Moody,
who lived in Bantam five years, and was there

            <p>SOme few dayes after the <hi>Dutch</hi> landed in <hi>Bantam,</hi>
in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> 1682. ſeveral <hi>Dutch</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
came into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory, and ſtole out
ſeveral things; and Twelve of them broke open the
Chamber Door of the aforeſaid <hi>Ambroſe Moody,</hi> and
carried away all that was therein, <hi>viz.</hi> Three Pecul
of <hi>Aggula-wood,</hi> Sixty Muſquets, One Cheſt of fine
Tea-Pots, One Barrel of Mum, and Fifteen dozen of
Pottle Bottles, and Two dozen of Wine, and ſeveral

            <p>

The <hi>Engliſh</hi> being all ordered to leave <hi>Bantam,</hi>
the ſaid <hi>Moody</hi> went to <hi>Batavia</hi> with the Agent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
where he ſpent above Four Months time; and being
inform'd that one <hi>Nynahaſſin</hi> a <hi>Moor-man,</hi> and others
who were indebted to the ſaid <hi>Moody,</hi> was gone to
<hi>Terrytyaſſa,</hi> (the Palace of the old King of <hi>Bantam,</hi>)
he having an opportunity, went thither to demand
his Debts: And upon his arrival, he requeſted the
favour of the King, that the ſaid <hi>Nynahaſſin</hi> might be
ſummoned to Court to give an accompt why he did
not pay the ſaid <hi>Moody:</hi> But when he came, he told
the King, that in the time of the Wars of <hi>Bantam,</hi> he
had delivered to the ſaid <hi>Moody,</hi> and Mr. <hi>William
Hodges</hi> to the value of 7000 Rs. 8/8 in Goods;
upon which the old King adviſed the ſaid <hi>Moody</hi> to
write to the Council of the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in <hi>Batavia,</hi> and deſire them to ſend word to the
<hi>Sultan,</hi> what was the real value of the ſaid Goods;
They being in their poſſeſſion, were able to give an
accompt of their true value; and if they would not
ſatisfie the ſaid <hi>Nynahaſſins</hi> Debt, then he would give
him order to ſeize upon all his Concerns. So the ſaid
<hi>Moody</hi> wrote to <hi>Batavia,</hi> and waited in <hi>Terrytyaſſy</hi>
about two Months for an Anſwer: But it being trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
times, could get none: So he reſolved to return
to <hi>Batavia</hi> himſelf, but the King adviſed him not to
go directly for <hi>Batavia,</hi> for fear of being cut off;
but to go to <hi>Cherringyen,</hi> and ſtay till arrival of an
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship; which he did, but could meet with none,
until the latter end of <hi>December,</hi> the <hi>Surrat Merchant</hi>
bring in ſight, the ſaid <hi>Moody</hi> could not procure a Boat
to go on board; it being ordered by the <hi>Java's,</hi> that
none ſhould go on board of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship. So he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to go to <hi>Bantam</hi> in a <hi>Java Prow,</hi> to take his
paſſage for <hi>Batavia:</hi> But upon his arrival at the <hi>Boome</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:61112:22"/>
in <hi>Bantam,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> ordered him to come aſhoar, and
immediately ſtopt him as Priſoner, and the next day
put about Twenty Five pound weight of <hi>Iron</hi> upon
his legs; the ſaid <hi>Moody</hi> demanded the reaſon of their
unjuſt Action; and had for Anſwer, that he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
that he was ſent by the Agent and Council of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, to aſſiſt the old King of <hi>Bantam</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, and then he ſhould be diſcharged, but not
before: He replyed, that if he ſhould confeſs that,
it would be falſe, and would rather dye in Priſon than
confeſs it.</p>
            <p>In the time of the ſaid <hi>Moody's</hi> Impriſonment in
<hi>Bantam,</hi> one <hi>David Oorly,</hi> and <hi>William Harmenſon,</hi>
with one <hi>Chriſtian Inſon,</hi> and <hi>Phillip Aldes,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers, did declare, they met with
but little plunder in <hi>Bantam,</hi> except what they had
out of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory; which by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
was conſiderable. Some part of the ſaid Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the aforeſaid <hi>Moody</hi> did ſee in the hands of the
<hi>Dutch, viz.</hi> Pepper, and ſmall Arms, and Armou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
Tools; ſome of the Chirurgeons Inſtruments and
Medicines, and Bottles, (which they ſaid had been full
of Wine) and part of the <hi>Mallay</hi> Library, and Books
of Accompts, and other Writings of the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi>
Company; which ſupplyed the <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers
for ſix Months time, for Cartridges. The aforeſaid
<hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers at the <hi>Boome</hi> did declare, that ſome of
them had played away to the value of One Thouſand
<hi>Rs.</hi> 8/8 a Man in a days time, of thoſe Goods which
were plundred out of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Moody</hi> being in the old King's Palace, the
5<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1682. did hear him ſay, that he had
nothing in his Territories but what he had received
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61112:23"/>
from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to them he would give it again,
with the poſſeſſion of all his Forces, upon the arrival
of the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships; and <hi>Pengran Probaya</hi> the
General of all his Forces, did likewiſe declare, that he
would ſurrender up his Charge.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> being landed at <hi>Tancoratt,</hi> the <hi>Javans</hi>
all left <hi>Terrytyaſſy,</hi> except the <hi>Sultan,</hi> two <hi>Pengrans,</hi>
and two <hi>Engliſh</hi> men which were employed as Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
at ſight whereof the King being troubled, ſet
fire to the Palace himſelf, and fled up the Hills; and
about a Month after, the young King ſent to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and promiſed him his Freedom and Liberty, if
he would come and live with him in the Fort; who
conſented to it upon the following terms, <hi>viz.</hi> (as he
was informed.) That the <hi>Engliſh French</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi>
might have the ſame liberty that they had formerly;
and that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Renegado ſhould be turned out of
the Fort; and that when he came in, no <hi>Dutch-man</hi>
ſhould ſtir from his Quarters; which was conſented
to. But three dayes after he was in the Caſtle, the
<hi>Dutch</hi> deſired the Son to demand his Father's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
who told him that he had given it all to his Son
<hi>Pengran Probaya,</hi> who is gone up the Hills with Four
Thouſand <hi>Macaſſars</hi> and <hi>Mallayans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 18<hi>th July</hi> 1683, all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being going
from <hi>Batavia</hi> for <hi>Surrat,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Council in <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam</hi>
ſent for the aforeſaid <hi>Ambroſe Moody,</hi> and after
Examination diſcharged him, and ordered him to take
his paſſage to <hi>Batavia</hi> in a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship.</p>
            <p>When the two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men which had been with
the old King came down the Hills, the <hi>Javans</hi> carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them before the Chief of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who ordered
them to go before the young King; who when he ſaw
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61112:23"/>
them, gave them their liberty to go where they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
But three dayes after the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſent to the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gran</hi>
(who lives in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory) and ordered
him to keep the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gunners cloſe Priſoners; All
which was told and affirmed to him by the Brother of
the ſaid <hi>Pengran.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 22th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1683. The Agent and Council
of the Engliſh Nation ſet ſail from <hi>Batavia</hi> for <hi>Surat;</hi>
at which time the Dutch had Wars with the King of
<hi>Jambee,</hi> and the King of <hi>Jehore;</hi> and on the Weſt
Coaſt of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> and with <hi>Rogia Pelatta</hi> the King of
<hi>Macaſſar,</hi> who formerly ſerved the Dutch, but is
now fled from them with his Forces, and dayly
<hi>Mallayans</hi> and <hi>Macaſſars</hi> go from <hi>Batavia</hi> and <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam</hi>
to his aſſiſtance. The Dutch at <hi>Ambonia</hi> ſent
this year (as he hath heard ſeveral of them confeſs)
Fifty Dutchmen to <hi>Batavia</hi> in Irons becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to Revolt.</p>
            <p>Sometime before the Engliſh left <hi>Batavia,</hi> the
Dutch had been a fitting of nine ſhips and a Fleet of
Prowes to go againſt <hi>Macaſſar;</hi> but finding they had
not men ſufficient to man them, were forced to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
till next year.</p>
            <p>Now they ſuffer no <hi>Java</hi> to wear either Launce or
Creaſe, or any other Weapon; and the beſt <hi>Java</hi>
that is in <hi>Bantam,</hi> muſt pull off his Cap to any Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
Although the Dutch have not above Three or
Four Hundred Men in <hi>Bantam,</hi> yet the Young King
hath not power to act any Thing; and all <hi>Javans</hi> pay
to the Dutch at their Marriage Ten <hi>Rs.</hi> 8/8 and Two
<hi>Rs.</hi> 8/8 per month for each Fiſhing Prow, and Two
Ditto a year Head-money; and ſeveral other Taxes
which makes the <hi>Javans</hi> daily run from <hi>Bantam</hi> to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61112:24"/>
               <hi>Pengran Probaya:</hi> So that now he hath about Ten
Thouſand Men in the Field, and is in expectation that
the Engliſh will ſend to His aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The Dutch Received the Letters which were ſent
by the Ambaſſadors, and interpreted them as they
pleaſed: And would not ſuffer the Ambaſſadors, nor
no <hi>Java</hi> to ſpeak to the Young King, but by their
Lingueſter.</p>
            <p>The Young King with his own Hands did creaſe his
Uncle <hi>Pengran Coloone,</hi> and keeps his Brothers which
came in, faſt in irons: <hi>Pengran Keedull</hi> did come in
with the Old King; but finding how ſevere the Young
King was, made his eſcape with ſeveral other great
Men.</p>
            <p>The Dutch could not perſwade the Young King to
ſign to their Articles; at which they are much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>
            <p>The Dutch have perſwaded the Young King to turn
out of <hi>Bantam</hi> all <hi>Europeans,</hi> the <hi>Moors, Banyans,</hi> and
the <hi>Chineſes,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>January,</hi> 168 2/3, <hi>Ambroſe Moody</hi> did ſee in <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam</hi>
the Two great braſs Guns which came from <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queen;</hi>
which (he thinks) the <hi>Company</hi> have not
charged to accompt.</p>
            <p>The Young King of <hi>Bantam</hi> muſt pay to the Dutch
for every White Man that they loſe in the Wars, or
by ſickneſs, Thirty Rs. 8/8 and Twenty for each
Black. They have loſt already by their own confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Fifteen Hundred <hi>Europeans</hi> by ſickneſs and by the
Warrs, ſince the 18th. of <hi>July,</hi> 1683. the <hi>Chief</hi> of
the Dutch was poiſoned in <hi>Bantam;</hi> and very oft as
the ſoldiers go to Market, they are killed with Clubs.</p>
            <p>The Young King, by inſtigation of the Dutch,
keeps His Father cloſe priſoner; and ſuffers onely one
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61112:24"/>
ſlave-Woman to bring him Victuals, which ſhe puts
in at a Window, and keeps Centinel always at the
door.</p>
            <p>In the time of the aforeſaid <hi>Moody's</hi> impriſonment,
there was ſent to him in <hi>Bantam,</hi> from Mr. <hi>Gurney</hi>
which did belong to the <hi>Kempthorne,</hi> a Letter by the
Hands of <hi>Nicholas Dios;</hi> which he did ask leave of
the Dutch to deliver, and had conſent; but within
two days after, the Dutch put the ſaid <hi>Dios</hi> in priſon,
and would not diſcharge him before the Engliſh came
from <hi>Batavia,</hi> which was about five months time after
his firſt impriſonment.</p>

            <p>AS the Directors of the <hi>Eaſt-India-Company</hi> of
the United Provinces have been very ſenſibly
moved to ſee that the differences of <hi>Bantam</hi> have been
able to cauſe a difference between the two Companies,
whoſe intereſt is ſo much never to be diſ-united; ſo
they have been very glad to underſtand, that it hath
pleaſed his Majeſty to name four Lords as Illuſtrious
by the Qualities of their minds, as of their birth and
office, to labour jointly with the Deputies of the Lords
the States General of the United Provinces, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
of the ſaid differences; and to prevent by the
wayes of Juſtice and Equity, this coldneſs from ever
being capable of ſowing ſeeds of bitterneſs, which
might be able to deſtroy the remainder of this brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
love which ought to be the Bond of Union, and good
Intelligence between the two Companies.</p>
            <p>The under-written Deputies of the Company of
the ſaid Provinces, who have the honour to defend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Excellencies, the Right and the Innocency of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61112:25"/>
their Company; to ſpare your Excellencies the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of an obſcure and perplext diſcourſe, will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
as much as it is poſſible for them, to unfold the
matter, and to govern their Defence by the order of
nature, which enlightens with its clearneſs, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
propoſed to be treated of: and deviding, for
this reaſon, their anſwer into two principal parts;
they will conſider in the firſt place, the nature of
the demand of the Engliſh Company in its proper
ſcope; and will afterwards examine upon what
it is founded.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt point, ſince the demand ought to be
the Baſis and foundation of a Judicial Deciſion; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwritten
Deputies could have wiſhed that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
of the Engliſh Company, in relation to the
point of their Re-eſtabliſhment in <hi>Bantam,</hi> would have
explained with more clearneſs than they have done in
their Memorial which they exhibit inſtead of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
for although there be there mentioned the Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtitution
of <hi>Bantam,</hi> and the delivery of the Fort of the
ſaid Town, and laſtly the recalling of the <hi>Dutch</hi> forces
from <hi>Bantam,</hi> and out of all the Territories which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the ſaid Town, and that whole Kingdom
almoſt, in the ſame terms with the Memorial of the ſaid
Commiſſioners of the Engliſh Company, of the Tenth
and of the Seventeenth of <hi>June;</hi> wherein, beſides the
re-calling of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Forces, they pretend that
the Town of <hi>Bantam</hi> ſhould be reſtored (as they word
it) into the hands of His Majeſty: The under-written
Deputies could never without difficulty, nor can yet
believe, that the expreſſion concerning the Reſtitution
of <hi>Bantam</hi> could be expected to be underſtood literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For ſince before the laſt War of <hi>Bantam,</hi> the
Engliſh Company had in the Capital City but a houſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61112:26"/>
and Reſidence, without having had there, or pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to, any Right or Territory; it's unconceivable
with what appearance of Juſtice it can pretend to that
which it never poſſeſt, and to what it hath never had
any real pretence founded upon propriety (<hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>)
which not only according to the Civil Law, but
alſo according to that of Nature, ought to be the
ground of a real action (<hi>Rei vindicatio:</hi>) beſides that
it is not to be comprehended, to demand more than it
hath loſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The City and Fort of <hi>Bantam</hi> inſtead of a
Houſe which the Company there poſſeſt, and of which
the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> hath driven the Engliſh out of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam:</hi>
and from whom doth the Engliſh Company de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the City and Fort of <hi>Bantam?</hi> From the Company
of <hi>Holland</hi> which enjoys there only a bare Reſidence,
without any Right of Territory or Authority, which
is intirely inherent in the perſon of the King. But how
ſhould they diſpoſe of the City of <hi>Bantam?</hi> And in
what manner ſhall they put it into the Hands of the
Engliſh? ſhall they drive away the King of <hi>Bantam</hi>
from it? Whom notwithſtanding the Honour which
the late King of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> (of glorious Memory)
did him by the Reception of his Ambaſſadors, and the
great reſpects which the Engliſh Company ſhewed
to him in the Letter they Writ to him in the Year,
1682, They would now make paſs for a pitiful fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and a ſlave to <hi>Batavia.</hi> But it may be they would
have the Dutch Company make the King of <hi>Bantam,</hi>
yeild up the ſaid Town to the Engliſh; But in what
manner? Probably by threatning the <hi>Indian</hi> Prince to
leave him to the mercy of his Enemies, by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Troops from <hi>Bantam.</hi> But if the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Batavia</hi> be obliged to maintain and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
the King againſt his Enemies, (as it is really and
effectually engaged to do) muſt they break their word
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61112:26"/>
and falſifie their faith to accommodate the Engliſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in <hi>Bantam?</hi> This would be unjuſt, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
morally impoſſible, as are all things which
cannot be compaſſed with Juſtice and publick Faith;
which there is as much obligation to keep with an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Prince, as there is with the moſt conſiderable and
moſt potent King of the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>Againſt which, the politick remark of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
of the Engliſh Company in the 5th. Paragraph of
their demand, ſignifies nothing; where the ſay, <q>That
to alledge the obligation of protecting an Allye, is but
a politick artifice to Baniſh for ever peace between
the Engliſh and the Dutch in <hi>India;</hi> becauſe there will
be nothing more eaſie than to make War by theſe
means between any other Princes and their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
or their Sons or Brothers; and then take a ſide,
and condition with the prevailing ſide, to exclude the
Engliſh and all other <hi>Europeans.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For although it would be a very baſe and Criminal
action, to make quarrels between <hi>Indian</hi> Princes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
with an intention to make advantage of them
againſt the <hi>Europeans;</hi> yet no man in his Right ſenſes
can doubt, but that according to the Law of Nations,
it is Lawful for any <hi>Europeans</hi> to make Treaties and
Alliances with <hi>Indian</hi> Princes, which make a very
conſiderable part of man-kind; and that the abuſe
which may be made of this, is no more able to take
away this liberty, than evil uſage which <hi>European</hi>
Princes may make, and do very often, of their Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
can deprive them of their Right of making them
when they think fit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:61112:27"/>
That the Artifice, of which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
ſpeak, <hi>viz.</hi> of making a War between the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Princes, to exclude the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the Trade,
(as they ſay in the Sixth and Seventh Paragraphs of
their demands) is an old and diſcovered trick of the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> they will never prove: But it will be ſeen on
the contrary, in the ſequel of this Anſwer, that the
Government of <hi>Batavia</hi> cannot be accuſed to having
either kindled or fomented the War of <hi>Bantam</hi> (of
which is now treated) or perfidiouſly drawing the
young King under their Yoke; but by want of Charity,
and a paſſionate Spirit, which diſcovers it ſelf in the
End of their Demands; wherein they ſeem to wiſh,
His Majeſty would decide by force of Armes, an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
upon which on each part, we ought with a Spirit
of Submiſſion and Acquieſcency, to wait for the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of your Excellencies.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond point, <hi>viz.</hi> The Juſtice of the
Demand, and the Ground upon which it is founded;
which ought to be the truth of the Complaints of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Company againſt that of <hi>Holland</hi> upon the
matter of <hi>Bantam;</hi> the underwritten Perſons can't
doubt, but that your Excellencies will think fit and
proper, before the matter be entred into, that it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
if it be true, that on the parts of the High
and Mighty Lords the <hi>States-General,</hi> and on that of
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, it hath been agreed (as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company do alledge) that
Reſtitution ſhould be made of <hi>Bantam;</hi> the diſcuſſion of
which Affair as a preliminary (<hi>Queſtio prejudicialis</hi>)
ought to precede the examination of the truth of the
Complaints, in which conſiſts the principal cauſe; for,
in Effect, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners would have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
if the Affair concerning the Reſtitution of <hi>Bantam</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:61112:27"/>
were determined by their High and Mightineſſes, and
the Company of <hi>Holland</hi> not to ingage themſelves in a
long Suit, being able to make an end of the Affair,
without breaking their Heads with ſo many Diſputes;
but as theſe Gentlemen have been miſtaken in writing
of a few Lines, as it appears by their Anſwer of 27<hi>th
July</hi> to the Memorial of us the underwritten, of the
19<hi>th</hi> of the ſame Month, where the word of Deciſors,
at which they are ſo angry, is not to be found; but that
of Negotiators is uſed; 'tis not much to be wondred at,
that they ſhould be miſtaken in the Explication of the
Anſwer of the <hi>States General</hi> to the Memorial of Sir
<hi>John Chardin,</hi> to which they refer in their Demand.</p>
            <p>Their High and Mightineſſes love juſtice too much,
to have been willing to diſpoſe of a Town that did
not belong to them, and to which they had no right:
It is true, that they offered not only, not to hinder
the reſettlement of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Bantam,</hi> from being
obſtructed either by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, or any of
their Subjects, but alſo to further it themſelves, and
to make the ſaid Company to aſſiſt them in it; which
is far from that which the Deputies of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Company ſay in their Demands.</p>
            <p>But it being important to prove here, that the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Company cannot, at this time, take hold of the
Anſwer of their High and Mightineſſes, no more than
of the advances which the Company of <hi>Holland</hi> made
in the year 1683, towards the accommodating the
Differences which the War of <hi>Bantam</hi> had made to
ariſe between the two Companies; who muſt have
recourſe to what paſſed between Sir <hi>John Chardin</hi> and
the Deputies of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company on the ſubject of
the ſaid Differences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:61112:28"/>
It is certain, that at that time it was not known in
what condition the Affairs of <hi>Bantam</hi> were; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the War between the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> yet laſted,
or whether it was ended; and if it were determined,
whether it were done by a treaty, or by force of Arms;
if by Arms which of the two the Father or the Son, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
Conqueror, and Maſter of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It being alſo leſs known whether the Son, (in caſe
that by the Auxiliary Arms he was reſettled in his
Throne) had not granted to the Company of <hi>Holland,</hi>
in recompence of their Aſſiſtance, ſome right in <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam;</hi>
by virtue of which they might have been able
to diſpoſe of the reeſtabliſhment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their
former Reſidence. Beſides, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company
might reaſonably promiſe themſelves, that the King
of <hi>Bantam</hi> who owed his Deliverance from the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
in which he was, to the Auxiliary Arms of
the Company, would not be diſpleaſed, that to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would never aſſiſt his Father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, they had engaged to cauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to
be reſettled, in their former Habitation; which Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
would not have place any more, after that
the Father was reduced under the Power of his Son.</p>
            <p>In theſe uncertainties the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company made
ſome Advances, and Sir <hi>John Chardin</hi> drew up a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Accommodation between the two Companyes,
wherein it is ſpoken of the withdrawing the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Forces from <hi>Bantam,</hi> and of what each of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
ſhould be obliged to do in the Caſes therein ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed.
But it having pleaſed Mr. <hi>Chudleigh</hi> and Sir
<hi>John Chardin</hi> to break up (ſomewhat abruptly) the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation
which was already very far advanced, and
that it pleaſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company to refuſe all the
Offers as well of the <hi>States General,</hi> as thoſe which the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61112:28"/>
Embaſſador <hi>Citters</hi> made here in <hi>London</hi> in the Name
and on the behalf of the Company of the <hi>United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;</hi>
after the return of the ſaid Sir <hi>John Chardin,</hi>
the laſt Company did not think it proper to follow
the Negotiation, with which my Lord Embaſſador
<hi>Citters</hi> was charged, upon the foot of thoſe offers
which had been deſpiſed, and by which they were,
by conſequence, no more tyed, eſpecially when in the
latter end of the year 1683, they underſtood by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from <hi>India,</hi> that the War of <hi>Bantam</hi> was ended,
with advantage to the Son, who remained in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Kingdom of <hi>Bantam,</hi> the Father being made
Priſoner, and the Rebels Power overcome; without
(however) having granted to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company any
Right, by virtue of which they might be able to ſettle
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> again in <hi>Bantam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To what purpoſe is it then to alledge at this time,
the Anſwer of the <hi>States General</hi> to the Memorial of
Sir <hi>John Chardin,</hi> after that they have publickly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
their offers, and propoſed new Conditions, which
appeared to their High and Mightineſſes ſo much out
of all reaſon, that they would not ſo much as allow
them to give ſo much as an Ear to them, as it appears
by the Reſolution of their High and Mightineſſes quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
B. How can the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company then ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that excepting at preſent the offers which they
refuſed two years ago, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company ſhould
think themſelves obliged to it, after the change of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
which hath happened at <hi>Bantam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have not they declared that after the ſaid change the
Treaty could not continue any longer, upon the foot
of the Offers which they had rejected, with ſo much
diſdain? And although they had not declared it, was it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61112:29"/>
not a thing viſible and evident of it ſelf, to conclude a
project, which ſuppoſing a perfect uncertainty of the
Affairs of <hi>Bantam,</hi> contain cauſes which at preſent
cannot happen: Beſides, it is not to be conceived how
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company after having choſen themſelves
the way of deciſion in purſuance of the year 1674,
and 1675, and preſt for this Effect, the Nomination
of the deciding Commiſſioners, can at preſent make
uſe of the offers and projects of Accommodation,
which they themſelves cauſed to be broken off; and
which beſides has nothing of Common, with a judicial
diſcuſſion, in which the two Companyes are at preſent
engag'd; and from which they can't diſmiſs themſelves,
to return to the Treaty, but by a Common Conſent:
the underwritten Deputies of the Company of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
having proved at preſent, that neither from the
offers of their High and Mightineſſes, nor thoſe of the
ſaid Company of <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company can
infer any thing which is capable of making good their
Demands; we will now paſs to the ſecond point,
which is, that of the juſtice of the Complaints of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Company, and will Examine in them, firſt
their Nature, and in what they conſiſt, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
in the ſecond place, the ſtrength of the proofes
which have been delivered to the underwritten, to
make them good.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt point, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to the King of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> of Glorious
Memory, as it appears by the Letter his Majeſty
wrote to the aforeſaid Lords the States General, dated
the 23th. <hi>April</hi> 1683, that the Sieur St. <hi>Martin</hi>
Commander in Chief of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Forces and Ships,
(which the Government of <hi>Battavia</hi> had ſent to the
aſſiſtance of the King of <hi>Bantam</hi>) had committed great
violences upon the Factors, Servants and Effects, of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61112:29"/>
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company at <hi>Bantam,</hi> even to the diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
them of, and driving them from, their antient
reſidence; and Mr. <hi>Chudleigh</hi> then Envoy from his
ſaid Majeſty to the States General, ſays in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial,
which he preſented to them in the Month of
<hi>May</hi> of the ſaid Year 1683, that the King of <hi>Great
Brittain</hi> his Maſter, having underſtood by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of his Company of Merchants Trading into
the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> in what an extraordinary manner
thoſe of <hi>Battavia</hi> had affronted and drove away from
<hi>Bantam</hi> all thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, which had
been ſetled there for ſo many years; his Majeſty could
not avoid being ſenſible of ſuch a proceeding; without
the Companies ever troubling themſelves with verify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo black an accuſation, with which they have filled
all <hi>Europe,</hi> to prepoſſeſs it to the diſadvantage of the
Company of the United Provinces.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Chardin,</hi> who in the year 1683 was depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the behalf of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company into <hi>Holland,</hi>
for the Affair of <hi>Bantam,</hi> endeavouring to riſco the
ſaid Company from the plunge into which the want of
proofes had caſt them, thought of changeing the Byafs,
and inſtead of accuſing the Government of <hi>Batavia</hi> for
having drove the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from <hi>Bantam,</hi> contented
himſelf with imputing their going out of the Town to
the ſuggeſtion and advice of the ſaid Sieur St. <hi>Martin,</hi>
who 'tis ſaid, had inclined the King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> to
turn the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of his Country; making uſe for
proof of an Affirmative ſo ill founded, but on a bare
conjecture grounded only upon want of Charity,
which we ſhall prove upon the Examination of the
principal cauſe; it being enough to obſerve here by
the by, that the Circumſtances upon which Sir <hi>John
Chardin</hi> grounded his ſuſpition, are ſo little conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that there is reaſon to wonder, a Man of Parts
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61112:30"/>
ſhould pretend to make uſe of them, in a publick
manner.</p>
            <p>The Deputies of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company holding at
preſent the ſame Language, ſay in their Memorial,
which they have annexed to their demand, that the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> at <hi>Batavia</hi> have made and fomented the
quarrels between the Old and the Young King of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam;</hi>
and in their demand that thoſe of <hi>Batavia</hi> having
made the young King fall into their Snares, and drawn
him perfidiouſly under their Yoke, to compaſs to
themſelves the entire Trade of that Place, excluſive to
all others; compell'd him to put the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of his
Dominions.</p>
            <p>Theſe Complaints are very terrible, and at the
ſame time, very juſt if they are true: but they are
very black Calumnies, and very unjuſt reproaches, if
they are falſe, as they will be proved to be in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
of this Anſwer; 'Tis not that the Subſcribers
think that the Directors of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company are
the Inventers of it, (God forbid) but that they have
only too eaſily ſuffered themſelves to be led away by
Reports ill grounded and ſown every where; with a
deſign to blacken the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, and to render
it odious: But theſe Reports, although they have no
other Grounds but Lyes and Scandals, have inſinuated
themſelves into the minds of ſeveral Perſons, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the Parties concerned, by the means of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity,
Jealouſie, and Miſtruſt.</p>
            <p>The Subſcribers, although they might intrench them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in a bare Negative, and keep ſolely upon the
Defenſive, without advancing of any Affirmative, which
may oblige them to Juſtification and Proofes; have
notwithſtanding propoſed to themſelves, before the
diſcuſſion of the Juſtificative Papers of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
be entred into, to give your Excellencies a true
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61112:30"/>
               <hi>Idea</hi> of the Affair of <hi>Bantam,</hi> but not intending to
leave their hold, which is the Negative; but only
with a proſpect of making their Defence the ſtronger,
as it will appear ſupported by the truth of Facts,
which are indiſputable, and which deſtroy and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
from top to bottom, all that the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company have advanced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sultan Agan</hi> King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> and Father to the
preſent King, finding himſelf too weak, by reaſon of
his great Age, to continue to bear the weight of the
Government, yielded up the Kingdom of <hi>Bantam</hi> to
his Eldeſt Son, retiring to <hi>Turchaſer,</hi> a charming and
delightful place, about ſix Leagues from the Town of
<hi>Bantam,</hi> and about a League from the Sea, to enjoy
there an agreeable Repoſe, and to finiſh there the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of his Life in quiet, and out of the troubles
of the Affairs of the Kingdom: The Son having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
the Throne, ſent Embaſſadors to thoſe of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia,</hi>
as to his neareſt Neighbours, to ſignifie to them,
his acceſſion to the Empire; as he alſo diſpatched others,
afterwards to the late King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Memory; who acknowledging their Character,
gave them ſuch a Reception, that the Gentlemen of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Company themſelves, exaggerating the Honours
which were turned to the ſaid Embaſſadors here at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
ſaying in the Letter which they wrot to the King of
<hi>Bantam</hi> in the Month of <hi>June,</hi> in the Year 1682, and by
conſequence two years after his coming to the Crown,
that they had treated his Embaſſadors in as magnificent
a manner, as if they had come from the greateſt Prince
of the Earth; adding in the ſame Letter, that they had
heard that God with the conſent of his Father, had
eſtabliſhed and ſettled him on the Throne of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Suroſoan,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>Bantam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:61112:31"/>
But the People being accuſtomed, under the Reign
of the old King, to a looſer Government then that of
the young King, who kept them in ſubjection; they
began to murmur, and at length took up Arms to throw
off the Yoke; having engaged in their Party by evil
Impreſſions and Importunities, the old King of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi>
whom they had taken out of his Retirement,
and prevailed with him to make himſelf Maſter of the
Town, and afterwards to beſiege the Fort, into which
the young King had retired to ſave his Life; who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf upon the brink of the Precipice, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two fingers breadth of his Ruine, diſpatched Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Servants to thoſe of the Government of <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
to repreſent to them the ſad Condition of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and to pray their Succours: But the Gentlemen
of the Government of <hi>Batavia,</hi> being too prudent and
too circumſpect, to embarque themſelves in an Affair
of this importance, they thought it fit before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
upon any thing, upon the ſollicitations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the <hi>Indian</hi> Prince, to inform themſelves of
the Condition of his Affairs; and even after having
found that they were very bad, and almoſt deſperate,
would not reſolve upon any thing notwithſtanding in
his Favour, until they had interpoſed their good
Offices for Peace: which being deſpiſed by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who made no Anſwer to them, they at length
took up their Reſolution of aſſiſting the Son againſt
the Rebels, and to deliver him from the Oppreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wherein he was; which they had the happineſs
to Effect, and to Re-eſtabliſh him upon his Throne,
whereon being ſettled, he made the <hi>Engliſh</hi> go from
<hi>Bantam</hi> being ſatisfyed (as he was) that they had aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
his Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61112:31"/>
This is the true Hiſtory of the laſt War of <hi>Bantam,</hi>
and of what paſſed there from the beginning of it to
the end; in which the government of <hi>Batavia</hi> had no
other ſhare, then the bare aſſiſting of a Prince againſt
his Rebellious ſubjects; wherewith the Gentlemen of
the Engliſh Company cannot be dis-ſatisfied, if they
are pleaſed to deveſt themſelves of their propoſition,
and to make a ſerious reflection upon the following
conſiderations.</p>
            <p>I. That the Old King of <hi>Bantam</hi> having reſigned his
Empire to his Eldeſt ſon, he by this conceſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
lawful King, and that he was acknowledged as
ſuch by the late King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> of glorious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;
and by thoſe of the Engliſh Company, as it
may be proved as well by His ſaid Majeſties Letter to
the Young King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> as by thoſe of the Engliſh
Company to the ſaid King.</p>
            <p>II. That he being lawful King His ſubjects taking
up arms to dethrone him are Rebels.</p>
            <p>III. That according to the Law of Nature, and
that of Nations, it is not only lawful to aſſiſt a King,
oppreſſed by his ſubjects, but that this aſſiſtance ought
alſo to be looked upon as a work of Charity.</p>
            <p>IV. That it is alſo contrary to the ſame Law, to
impute the unhappy conſequences of an allowed and
juſt occaſion, to the perſon who is Author of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and not of the conſequences.</p>
            <p>V. And by conſequence that there is nothing more
contrary to Reaſon, then to charge the Government
of <hi>Batavia,</hi> and their Auxiliary Arms, with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
the Engliſh from <hi>Bantam,</hi> ſince it is evident,
that the ſending away the Engliſh from <hi>Bantam,</hi> was
not a neceſſary conſequence of it, but only a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61112:32"/>
by accident; the <hi>Indian Prince</hi> having ſent them
away not becauſe he was victorious (for he had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to enjoy their Habitation peaceably from his
coming to the crown, until the War, that is to ſay,
almoſt two years together,) but only becauſe he was
perſwaded that they had aſſiſted His Enemies.</p>
            <p>The under-ſigned Deputies of the Dutch Company
having by what they have urged hitherto, cleared the
way to a true underſtanding of the controverſie,
which is now under conſideration between the two
Companies; do not at all doubt but that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Engliſh Company themſelves, comparing
the ſtate of the queſtion, and that which they ought to
prove; will perceive the weakneſs of their own
proofs, which in effect do either prove nothing at all,
or at leaſt that which is in diſpute, and from which can
be inferred that which they inferre from it.</p>
            <p>The ſubſcribers therefore, now paſſing to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of the proofs of the Engliſh Company,
(which is the ſecond point of this diſcuſſion) will ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the Facts of importance from thoſe that are not
ſo, and which ſignifie nothing, or which are of no
other uſe, at moſt, but to blacken and encreaſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt,
Jealouſie and Suſpition.</p>
            <q>The Important Facts are theſe, viz.</q>
            <p>That thoſe of <hi>Batavia</hi> have made and fomented
the quarrels between the Old and Young Kings of
<hi>Bantam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that having beguiled the Young King
into their power, to appropriate to themſelves the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61112:32"/>
entire Trade of that place excluſive from all others,
compelled him to force the Engliſh out of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Facts which the Commiſſioners of the
Engliſh Company ſet down in their Memorial, and in
their demand, after having repreſented two years ago
to the late King of great <hi>Brittain</hi> of glorious Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
what can be immagined of blackeſt, that the Sieur
St. <hi>Martin</hi> Commander in Chief of the forces and
Ships, which the Goverment of <hi>Batavia</hi> had ſent to
the King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> had uſed and committed great
violences upon the Factors ſervants and effects of the
Engliſh Company at <hi>Bantam,</hi> to the having depoſed
and forced them from their antient reſidence.</p>
            <p>The under-written after having given themſelves
the trouble of Reading over and over, examining and
ſtudying with great application, all the proofs of the
Engliſh Company; do proteſt ſincerely, that they can't
find in them any thing which is capable of directly or
indirectly, by conſequences, to make good the enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the ſaid Facts; and although that by conſequence,
they might excuſe themſelves from ſaying any more of
it, they not being any way obliged to prove a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
which is not always poſſible, and can never be
done but indirectly, ſince it is againſt reaſon to prove
in a direct manner, that which is not: But yet to make
appear the innocency of the Goverment of <hi>Batavia,</hi>
in the affair of <hi>Bantam,</hi> and place them in a right light,
they will ſhew the moral impoſſibility of the ſaid Facts,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the government of <hi>Batavia,</hi> compelled the
Young King to force the Engliſh from <hi>Bantam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:61112:33"/>
As to the firſt Fact, it is certain that every rational
man that doth not do any thing hand over head, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
to himſelf naturally always ſome end in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
at leaſt in thoſe which are important, or may have
conſiderable conſequences: from hence comes it, that
in an inquiſition, when a man is accuſed of any crime,
(for Example of Murther, the author of which being
undiſcovered) though he be really guilty, it is always
inquired, <hi>cui bono,</hi> that is, why he ſhould have done
it, and when the reaſon of it can't be diſcovered, the
Judges are naturally enclined to believe, that the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
is void of all likelihood of Truth, eſpecially if
the accuſed perſon can make it appear that it was his
intereſt to preſerve the Life of the perſon Murthered.</p>
            <p>The under-written (to apply this maxime to the
government of <hi>Batavia,</hi> which they accuſe for having
made and fomented the quarrel between the Old and
the Young King of <hi>Bantam</hi>) deſire the Commiſſioners
of the Engliſh Company to explain to them (<hi>cui bono</hi>)
and with what deſign thoſe of <hi>Batavia</hi> ſhould give
themſelves the trouble, to put the Father at odds
with the Son, and to animate the one againſt the other?
What good could this do to them, and what advantage
could they reap from it? The Son had by his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
to the government of <hi>Batavia,</hi> (which he ſent
ſo ſoon as he was aſcended on the Throne) ſignified to
them, that he deſired to live well with them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to keep a good correſpondence with them, and to
uſe them more favourably then his Father had done in
his Reign, and in Effect thoſe of <hi>Batavia</hi> had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to complain of His behaviour towards them: And
why ſhould they then be willing to engage him in a
War againſt his Father, and his own ſubjects, and
expoſe him to the danger and hazard of loſing his
Crown, and of ſeeing his Father re-aſcend the Throne,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61112:33"/>
or his Younger Brother made King; and although the
War ſhould end to his advantage, what could he hope
from it, he who was already upon the Throne, and
who could not become greater, and what likelyhood
was there, that a man in his right ſenſes ſhould give
ear to an advice ſo extravagant, and ſo dangerous?
An advice that no body could reliſh, unleſs he were a
man fit to be ſhut up: From whence we muſt conclude,
That there were ſome people which not being able to
endure the government of the Young King, who did
not ſuffer himſelf to be noſed by his ſubjects, as his
Father who was too ſoft and too indulgent, did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt make the ſubjects riſe, and rebel againſt
their Prince, to throw off the yoke, and to ſet up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his place, which might be more to their minds,
and who would eaſily ſuffer an Anarchy, as they did
effectually afterwards take up Arms againſt the King,
to execute the criminal deſign, which they had brought
to the point, that the King had like to loſe his Crown,
and his Life. But it may be it was the government of
<hi>Batavia,</hi> which enflamed the Father and the ſubjects
of the Young King againſt their Prince, and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
perſwaded them, to take Arms and to throw off
the Yoke: But why and with what deſign may it be
asked? Only with the proſpect of making an advantage
by the War: For as thoſe of the ſaid government
were Divines and Prophets, and that by a ſpirit of
propheſie they were able to penetrate into the ſecrets
of futurity; they knew that the Warr would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
to the advantage of the Son; that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
would take part in it, and that they would aſſiſt
the Young Kings Enemies, or at leaſt they would be
perſwaded they did; and that upon this ſcore he would
turn the Engliſh out of his Kingdom: Thus far muſt
we carry the Viſion, and the extravagance, to make
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61112:34"/>
the Gentlemen of the government of <hi>Batavia</hi> paſs for
head ſtrong Mad people, fit to be put into an Hoſpital
for mad Men: To which alſo it muſt yet be added,
that thoſe of <hi>Batavia</hi> (for in fine we muſt believe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, though never ſo far from any likelihood of
Truth) had the Old King in their power, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the ſubjects of the Young Prince.</p>
            <p>But although the arguments by which the adverſe
parties are reduced to abſurdities, that they would
never confeſs themſelves, but which are natural and
neceſſary conſequences to be drawn from their poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
are (it may be) ſtrong enough to convince them
of the falſity, of what they advance in matters of
Fact.</p>
            <p>The under-written will notwithſtanding give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the trouble to demonſtrate, not only the little
likelihood which there is in the ſaid accuſations, but
alſo the moral impoſſibility of that which the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Batavia</hi> is charged with in this matter.</p>
            <p>The Young King being beſieged in His Fort, gave
notice of it to thoſe of <hi>Batavia,</hi> and deſired their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance;
repreſenting to them his miſerable condition,
and reiterating the ſaid requeſts divers times; this is
proved by the Letters marked D.</p>
            <p>The government of <hi>Batavia</hi> inquired into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of his affairs, and after having underſtood the
Truth of his complaints, would not however deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
any thing in favour of him, before they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
their mediation both to him, and his Father; as
it appears, as well by the Letters that they ſent to
each, quoted E and F. as by the relation of Mr. Saint
<hi>Martin</hi> markt G. and having in vain uſed all peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ways for ten whole dayes, as it appears by the
ſaid relation; they reſolved at laſt to ſend ſuccours,
which if they had defferred to do but one day longer, it
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61112:34"/>
had come too late, and after the deſtruction of the
Young King, who was then upon the point of yeilding.</p>
            <p>The under-written deſire the Gentlemen of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Company to deveſt themſelves for a moment of all
their prejudices, and then to tell them ſincerely, if
they can poſſibly imagine, that if the government of
<hi>Batavia</hi> had made and fomented the War between
the Father and the Son, they would have ſuffered the
Young King to languiſh in his Fort, ſighing after the
ſuccours which he had requeſted ſo often, and ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently,
if before the arrival of the Dutch Forces,
the Old King and the Rebels had made themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Fort, and that they had killed the Young
King, would not the ſuccours have come too late? and
thoſe of <hi>Batavia,</hi> could they have been able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Old King, or ſave others from ſeizing upon the
whole Kingdom? From whence it muſt be concluded,
that it is morally impoſſible that thoſe of <hi>Batavia,</hi>
ſhould have concerned themſelves to make a quarrel
between the Old and the Young King, and to raiſe
and foment a War.</p>
            <p>As to the Second of the ſaid Facts, Viz. <hi>That the</hi>
Hollanders <hi>of</hi> Batavia, <hi>having beguiled the Young King
into their power had compelled him to force the Engliſh out
of</hi> Bantam: It muſt be confeſſed it is a very bold
thing to urge Facts of this nature, without juſtifying
them with the leaſt proofs; there is not ſo much as
one witneſs of all thoſe which the <hi>Engliſh Commiſſioners,</hi>
have produced, who hath ſpoken the leaſt word of it;
Or that ſpeaks of any ſnares into which thoſe of <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
led the Young King; Or of the Yoke under which
they had perfidiouſly brought him. There is only Mr.
<hi>Waite,</hi> (whoſe depoſition is marked number 6) who
ſpeaking of the driving away of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61112:35"/>
               <hi>Bantam</hi> by the Kings Order, adds, that the Engliſh
Agent and Servants were aſſured, that ſuch an Order
was not voluntarily given by the King, becauſe the
day before, the Agent and Councel waiting upon the
King to repreſent to him that they had been Neuters
between the Father and the Son, and that they had
given him no manner of Reaſon to be diſpleaſed with
them; they could not perceive in him, either by his
Words or Actions, any thing which ſhew'd an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of baniſhing the Engliſh from his Countrey;
and it is certain, there was a diſpute between the
Young King and the Dutch Major, before the ſaid
Order could be obtained from him; but he being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
wholly under the power of the Dutch, was forced
to grant it.</p>
            <p>Upon which it is to be obſerved in the firſt place,
that it is not a Teſtimony founded upon the Witneſſes
own knowledge, but only a Depoſition grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what he believes to be true, and which he heard
related by ſeveral credible Perſons, as he ſays him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
at the end of his Depoſitions; having only made
Oath of the two firſt Articles of his Depoſitions;
whereof the firſt ſpeaks of the landing of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Commander at <hi>Bantam;</hi> and the ſecond of the Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Houſe, which the Reſident and the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers caus'd to be thrown down, and of the
Windows of the ſaid Houſe, which they ordered to be
dammed up (of which more hereafter) All which was
true to his own knowledge; and he believed the reſt
to be true, relying upon the credit of credible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Agent and Council be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to wait upon the King to perſwade him of their
neutrality, could not diſcover his Animoſity againſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61112:35"/>
them, nor the deſign which he had formed of driving
them out of <hi>Bantam;</hi> and even that they found him
much leſs (this much leſs ought to be obſerved) angry
with them, than the <hi>Dutch</hi> had publiſhed, he was:
And ſuppoſe alſo, that there was a great conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King and Mr. <hi>St. Martin,</hi> to what can be
reduced the Proofes urged at the <hi>Hague,</hi> or here, in
an Affair of this Importance? Was there ever ſuch a
pitiful Argument as this?</p>

            <p>The firſt marked Number 2. is an Abſtract of a
Letter from Captain <hi>John <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tber</hi> to Mr. <hi>Edward Rudge</hi>
Director of the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi> Company. In the
which the ſaid <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tber</hi> giving an Accompt of what he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61112:36"/>
met with in his Voyages, ſays, that being arrived in
the Road of <hi>Bantam,</hi> two of the Factors of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Company came on board to command him to ſail
for <hi>Batavia,</hi> where were the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Agent and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
informing him at the ſame time, of the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Bantam,</hi> the Poſſeſſion which the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
had taken of it: That going in his long Boat aſhoar,
to fetch freſh Water, he there ſaw with his Eyes that
which had been related to him by the Factors; that
the young King hearing he was aſhoar, deſired to
ſpeak with him, but that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Chief would not
allow him to do it. Theſe are the Contents of the
Letter which contain theſe three points, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>The Story of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factors.</item>
               <item>The Confirmation of the Truth of this Story by his
Eyes.</item>
               <item>The Deſire which the young King had to ſpeak with
him, but that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Chief would not allow him
to do it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>As to the Story of the Factors, it cannot be doubted
that the Town of <hi>Bantam</hi> was very much ruined,
both by the War and the Fire, which the Rebels
(according to their Relation) of the young King and
his Party, had kindled there before: But it is falſe
that this Deſolation was cauſed by the Poſſeſſion of the
<hi>Hollanders;</hi> for it was the young King (and not the
<hi>Hollanders</hi>) who retook the Poſſeſſion of it, having
reduced it to their Obedience with the Aſſiſtance of the
Government of <hi>Batavia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Confirmation of the ſaid Story, 'tis a
ſtrange thing, that the ſaid Captain <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tber</hi> ſeeing the
Deſolation of <hi>Bantam,</hi> ſhould be able to diſcern by
whom and how it was cauſed, and that he ſhould be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61112:37"/>
able to find out by the Ruines, the Author of its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:
But although the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſhould even
have contributed by their Auxilliary Arms, to disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
the Town (as there is great likelyhood they did)
this ought to be imputed ſolely to the Chance of War,
ſince no Body is obliged to anſwer for the Calamities
which commonly are its Conſequences: But this ought
to be underſtood only of a juſt War, as this without
doubt was, undertaken for the Aſſiſtance of a Prince
oppreſſed by his Rebellious Subjects.</p>
            <p>As to the third point of the ſaid Letter, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the young King deſired to ſpeak with Captain <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tber;</hi>
but that the Dutch Chief would never allow him to do
it: This good man ought to be ask't, how he knew that
the King had a mind to ſpeak with him? Had he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
it only to himſelf? Or did he know it onely by
Relation? For he doth not ſay that the King had ſeen
him, but onely that he had heard that he was aſhoar;
and by conſequence, he could not be aſſured, that
That which was told him was true: But in fine, what
would they inferr from all this? Would they infer
that the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> had ſubmitted himſelf to thoſe
of <hi>Batavia?</hi> That he was under their Yoke? (Oh the
pitiful conſequence!) For although the Dutch Chief
ſhould have diſſwaded the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> from his
deſign of ſeeing an unknown perſon, for fear that in
the condition wherein he was encompaſſed by his
Enemies, there ſhould be Snares laid for him, into
which he might fall; could this ſhew the leaſt ſlavery?
(trifles!) The moſt powerful Princes, ſometimes ſuffer
themſelves to be governed by the wholeſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of their Miniſters, and with much more reaſon
ought thoſe of their Alyes to be a wholeſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
upon them.</p>

The Abſtract of the Conſultations, without Book,
of <hi>Bantam</hi> markt No. 3. contains nothing which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
Refutation; for that which in the firſt place,
Mr. <hi>Goſnall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hodges,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fiſher</hi> Witneſſe,
<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>James De Roy</hi> entred into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with a Company of <hi>Dutch</hi> Musketeers, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Pengran Nata Nagaa,</hi> with ſome of his Forces
alſo, and that after a ſtrict ſearch in every one of the
Warehouſes, upon pretence of ſearching for ſome
Goods, which had been carryed out of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Factories; and that the ſame <hi>Deroy</hi> had ſealed it with
his own Seal; what doth this prove againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Company? The preſence of the King's two Servants
<hi>Pengran Nata Negaa,</hi> and <hi>James De Roy</hi> (who far
from ever having been Lieutenant to Mounſieur <hi>St.
Martin,</hi> had been in the ſervice of the young <hi>Sultan,</hi>
ſometime before the War) ſhews enough that this
Action was done by Publick Authority, that is to ſay,
by that of the Prince; and not being poſſible to know
by the ſaid Depoſition whether the ſearch was made
by the deſire of the Servants of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company;
the Subſcribers do alſo think they need ſay nothing of
it, adding only, that however it was not an Affair of
great Importance, ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> themſelves don't
complain that they then loſt any thing.</p>
            <p>As to the Depoſitions of Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jeff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cott,</hi>
and that of <hi>Harriſon,</hi> can't be wondred at; the
King having recovered the Town of <hi>Bantam</hi> from his
Enemies, by whom he was yet encompaſt; had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Behaviour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to be watched, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the entring and going out of their Ships, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the apprehenſion which he had of their plotting
ſome new and ill deſign againſt his Perſon, and Eſtate;
and that in the confuſion wherein Affairs then were,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61112:38"/>
the Goods of other Men were taken away, which the
Directors of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies Affairs of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam</hi>

than they were able to hinder (in the time when the
old King made himſelf Maſter of the Town of <hi>Bantam,</hi>
that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Reſident <hi>Caeff</hi> was forced to take flight,
and to ſhelter himſelf from the violence of the <hi>Banta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi>)
ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> (probably without the knowledge

it is proved from the Depoſition markt <hi>S.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the Depoſitions of <hi>Goſnal, Knipe,</hi> and
<hi>Burditt,</hi> alſo contained in the ſame Abſtract; the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers
will paſs it over without Remark, as being
far from being prejudicial, but rather advantagious to
the Cauſe which they defend; becauſe by them it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that the King's Edicts and Order for the ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from <hi>Bantam,</hi> were irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

            <head>The Affidavit of Captain John Fiſher markt
No. 4. contains three things.</head>
            <p>1 THat the next day after the Landing of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi>
he ſaw Soldiers under the Command
of <hi>James De Roy,</hi> throw down a Taffaty Flagg called
by the name of St. <hi>Georges Flagg,</hi> which he had upon
his Houſe, by Permiſſion and Order of the Council;
and that running immediately to his Houſe, he found
the ſaid <hi>De Roy</hi> with part of the ſaid Colours in his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61112:38"/>
Hand, of which he had torn the reſt, and given pieces
of it to his ſouldiers to make Scarfs of it.</p>
            <p>2. That the ſaid ſouldiers drank part of his Liquors,
and that they carried away the reſt with his Goods,
abuſing him, and putting Blacks into his houſe.</p>
            <p>3. That five days after the departure of the Engliſh
from <hi>Bantam,</hi> the Dutch ſouldiers went to the houſe
of the Engliſh Company, and that they ſent ſome of
their Blacks, to throw down the Flag, which was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Houſe.</p>
            <p>This is a terrible Action, and with which they have
made ſo much clutter, that it was thought fit two
years ago, to inſert it into a Memorial, which was
preſented to the Lords the <hi>States General</hi> upon the
ſubject of <hi>Bantam:</hi> But was there ever in Truth any
thing more weak and pitiful? For in the firſt place ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Hiſtory were true, and that the Depoſition
of one man alone might be credited; and that alſo in
his own caſe; the authour of the action however was
a man in the Kings ſervice, and by conſequence the
Soldiers were <hi>Bantamites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The firſt Flag (for two are mentioned)
though it were St. <hi>Georges</hi> Flag, could not raiſe the
Houſe of a particular, above thoſe of other Inhabitants,
nor give him any Right to reſpects which were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of freeing him from the diſorders of War, more
then any other: And as to the Flagg, and the uſe that
was made of it, (according to the depoſition of the
ſaid Captain) is there any reaſon to wonder, that a
Captain and Soldiers belonging to the King, ſhould
have taken off from the Houſe of a private man, the
Engliſh Colours, after that the King had lookt upon the
whole Nation as Enemies to his perſon and State?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:61112:39"/>
As to the ſecond part, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Soldiers had
drank up part of his Wines and Liquors, and that
they had carryed away the reſt with his Goods, and
that they had thereby cauſed him a conſiderable loſs,
which he makes amount to 600 Crownes, if he ſayes
the Truth he is certainly to be pityed very much,
but he can accuſe no body but the Kings Servants, and
the diſorders of War for it.</p>
            <p>As to the laſt point of the ſaid Depoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That
five days after the departure of the Engliſh from <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi>
the Dutch ſouldiers went into the Engliſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
Houſe; and that they had ſent ſome of their
black ſervants, to throw down their Colours: As all
this is juſtified but by the Relation and Advices of ſome
<hi>Chineſes,</hi> (who it is not ſaid whether they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
or not) it may be lookt upon as a ſtory, or a Tale
invented to blacken the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> for in fine how
could theſe <hi>Chineſes</hi> know, that theſe Blacks were ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to the Dutch ſouldiers, and not to the King?
Of which there was much more likelihood, ſince it is
very rare for common ſouldiers to have ſervants. But
after all, ſuppoſe the Dutch ſouldiers had executed the
Kings Orders, to whom the right of taking down the
Engliſh Flagg can't be diſputed, after having baniſhed
the whole Nation from <hi>Bantam,</hi> and could they blame
him for it? Not at all: But though the ſouldiers ſhould
have done it without the Kings Order, (which can't
be believed) it was only at moſt but a Military affront
which ought to be pardoned in the diſorders of War,
wherein the Laws of Modeſty and Decency are little
to be regarded; and however it can't be imputed to
thoſe who repreſented the Government of <hi>Batavia</hi> in
the time of the War, which have never failed in the
reſpect which they owe to Crown'd heads.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:61112:39"/>
Mr. <hi>Sweetings</hi> depoſition marked No. 5. contains
ſeven Articles, whereof he ſwears only the two firſt;
the five others being only grounded upon the relation
of credible perſons, as he ſays himſelf at the end of
his depoſition: But to what purpoſe is it to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to conjectures, after that the depoſition Markt
K: Which tells us that it was the Young King who
cauſed the colours which was upon the Engliſh houſe
to be taken away.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Article it is ſaid, that upon the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ariſing between the Old <hi>Sultan</hi> and the Young <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
his Son, the Warr being declared between them;
thoſe of the Dutch Government of <hi>Batavia,</hi> upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of aſſiſting the Young King, came with a Fleet
of Ships and Boats; and that endeavouring to Land the
14th. of <hi>March,</hi> 1681-82. they were beaten back by
the Old Kings Forces, and forced to retreat with their
Fleet to a greater diſtance from the Town, expecting
reinforcement from <hi>Batavia,</hi> which being arrived the
23th. Monſieur St. <hi>Martin,</hi> General of the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
landed his Men the 28th. and beating the Old Kings
Guards, which were poſted between the Sea-ſide, and
the Fort, where the Young King was beſieged by his
Father, was there immediately received by the Young
King, and ſet up their Dutch Colours, doing the
ſame upon the other principal places of the Town.</p>
            <p>He ſets out at firſt, with ſomewhat a malitious ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition,
ſaying, That thoſe of the Dutch government of
<hi>Batavia,</hi> upon pretence of aſſiſting the Young King
came with a Fleet of Ships and Boats, and he afterwards
miſtakes when he adds that it was the 14th. of <hi>March,</hi>
when the Dutch Fleet came thither to put this deſign in
Execution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:61112:40"/>
What meaneth this word of pretence? Would he
inſinuate thereby that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> came thither up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any other pretence but to aſſiſt the Young King, he
has reaſon if he means the 19th. of <hi>March</hi> for they had
then no other deſign, but that of pacification, but if he
ſpeaks of the 28th. when they Landed, he wrongs
thoſe of the government of <hi>Batavia,</hi> to ſuſpect them
for having aſſiſted the King, with any other proſpect
then that of delivering him from the oppreſſion of his
Rebellious ſubjects, which without the higheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
can't be ſaid of thoſe who did not offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to do this ſervice of the King, but who on the
contrary granted their ſuccours only to the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and earneſtneſs of his requeſts; after having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
in vain an Accommodation. But as Mr.
<hi>Sweeting</hi> miſtook when he believed that the deſign
which the Dutch had the 19th. of <hi>March,</hi> was the
ſame which they put in execution the 28th. of the ſame
month; 'tis neceſſary to undeceive him, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the Engliſh Company to take the thing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
higher.</p>
            <p>The government of <hi>Batavia</hi> after having well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
of the affairs of the Young King of <hi>Bantam,</hi>
offered themſelves to mediate between the Old
<hi>Sultan Agan</hi> and his Son, writing to this effect, two
Letters in obliging and civil terms, by which they
ſhewed not only the trouble which it gave them to ſee
the diſſenſion between the Father and the ſon; but alſo
the deſign which they had to endeavour to make a
friendly end of their differences, and with this proſpect
they ſent to <hi>Bantam</hi> Plenipotentiaries with their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to the two Kings, convoyed only but by one Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
three others having been ſent thither before. But
theſe Plenipotentiaries going to a place where all were
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61112:40"/>
in Arms, and that they did not know whether they
ſhould meet Friends or Enemies, they thought it was
neceſſary for their ſafety to put themſelves in a poſture
of defence, and to arm themſelves ſufficiently to be
able to reſiſt thoſe who forgetting the Law of Nations,
and the reſpect due to publick perſons, ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to attacque them: And this is that Fleet of Ships
and of Boats, which is pretended was ſent to <hi>Bantam,</hi>
there to Land their Forces. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> having wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſome dayes for the anſwer of <hi>Sultan Agan,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
receiving it; and not knowing well enough what
were the inclinations of the <hi>Javans</hi> towards them, they
re-tacked ſome Commanders with a Party to inform
themſelves more exactly of the poſture of affairs: But
after having advanc'd a little, they met with ſome <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans,</hi>
who asked them by the mouth of an Engliſh
Man, why they intermedled with the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Kings? To which having anſwered that
they came in the quality of Friends, to procure Peace
between a divided Father and Son; they were not long
without perceiving the deſign which was formed
againſt them; ſince the <hi>Javans</hi> drew together in thoſe
parts a body of Forces; and ſending out ſome fire
Ships, and ſome men of Warr, they made as if they
would attacque the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who were of too ſmall
a number of having any thoughts to undertake any
thing againſt an Enemy ſo powerful as that that
threatned them. The <hi>Javans</hi> proceeded from Threats
to Effects, fired upon the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and the Canon
(of which the Engliſh had the management) having
very much gauled the Dutch Ships, they were ſenſible
that they were reſolved, not only not to accept of their
mediation, but that they look't upon them alſo as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
which afterwards determined the government of
<hi>Batavia</hi> to free the Young King from his miſery by
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61112:41"/>
force of Arms, which notwithſtanding was not done
until the 28the of <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Colours which they ſay the <hi>Holl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>
ſet up after the Victory upon the Fort, and
every where elſe in the Town, (of which the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers
are notwithſtanding really ignorant) deſerves
no anſwer, ſince it is certain that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
having pretended any right to the Town of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi>
the Colours could be of no other uſe than the
ſervice of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Forces, which after the ſiege of
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Forces was raiſed, were poſted in all the
principal places of the Town; the <hi>Dutch</hi> Colours
having been ſet up by the Kings Order, in honour to
the Auxiliary Armes of the Government of <hi>Batavia,</hi>
but they did alwayes fly underneath the Kings Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Article of the ſaid <hi>Sweetings</hi> Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though there hath been a great deal of noiſe
made of it, is notwithſtanding, to take it rightly, the
innocenteſt thing in the World. Mr. <hi>Sweeting</hi> ſwears
that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Reſident <hi>Caeffe</hi> came with a Company
of Souldiers, and ſeveral Carpenters, into the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Companies back Court; commanding the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Agent to cauſe his Galleries to be beat down, and to
dam (that is to ſay, nail up) the Windows, to which
an <hi>Hollander</hi> who was in the Company added, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him, that if he did not do it immediately he
would do it himſelf, and that he did cauſe it to be done
immediately.</p>
            <p>In reading this Article, in the Terms wherein it is
couched, one would imagine, without doubt, that
there was a great outrage committed by the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi>
but thoſe who have any knowledge of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61112:41"/>
this afair will judge quite otherwiſe of it, this being
the true Relation of it. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> not being
willing to cauſe any inconvenience to any perſon in
<hi>Bantam,</hi> choſe their own Houſe to keep their Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine
of Ammunition and Victuals; but the Wall of
their Houſe touching in a little place the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
and that heretofore there came no light but
through the Lettice; where ſometime after the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
by the Old Kings Permiſſion, who ſought all occaſions
to trouble the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> had made great and large
open Windowes, and which was made a Gallery or
Balcony, which leaning 4 or 5 foot over the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Houſe, which is raiſed but 12 or 13, gave them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of hearing and ſeeing all that ever paſt in
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Reſidents Houſe: The Young King ſeeing
that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Houſe was like to be (in time of a
War) the great Magazine in the Garriſon, foreſaw
the dangerous conſequences of ſuch Inlets into a place
where was Powder and other Ammunitions of War:
Wherefore knowing that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would not cauſe
his Windowes to be ſhut up, nor take away the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony,
He himſelf ſent thither his people with a <hi>Dutch</hi>
Renegado, (who is here called barely a <hi>Hollander</hi>)
who having lived ſeveral years amongſt the <hi>Javans,</hi>
had gained the favour of the Prince, and had been
raiſed by him to the Dignity of a <hi>Pengran:</hi> As to
what is ſaid that their Reſident <hi>Caeff</hi> was preſent
there, that might very well be, becauſe this happened
at his door, and his duty was to take care of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine.</p>
            <p>This is the true Hiſtory of this affair, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
nothing in it of ill, and which beſides was done
by the Kings Authority, as it was proved by the fifth
Abſtract of Mounſieur St. <hi>Martins</hi> Conſiderations,
marked G.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:61112:42"/>
As to the firſt Article of the ſaid Depoſitions which
Mr. <hi>Sweeting</hi> believes to be true upon the credit of
credible perſons; (which is much to be wondred at).
It contains but two things; Firſt, the intimation which
the Kings Officer gave to thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> houſe,
containing a peremptory order from his Maſter to
make us leave <hi>Bantam,</hi> and this is confeſſed. Secondly,
That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Agent and Council were aſſured that
ſuch an Order was not voluntarily given by the King,
of whoſe opinion of them, although we have before
examined the Reaſons, we ought here to convince the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> of the wrong which they do the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in
accuſing them of having been the cauſe of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
from <hi>Bantam:</hi> It is confeſſed by both ſides,
that there was command given by the King to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> to go out of <hi>Bantam;</hi> but the diſpute is,
whether the King gave it of himſelf, or at the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> The <hi>Hollanders</hi> proteſt that
they do them great injuſtice to believe them capable
of an action of the nature of this: Are not the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
obliged to prove ſo uncharitable a fact? But have they
any proofs of it? Surely none at all. They ground
their opinions upon ill grounded jealouſies, and ſay,
that at the audience which the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> had
granted to them immediately after his Victory, they
could not remark his reſentment or indignation, and
that between him and Mounſieur St. <hi>Martin,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Forces, there was a very warm
converſation: But how do they prove theſe things of
this importance? Can we truſt to the looks of a Man
who hides his animoſity? Is there any one that heard
Mounſieur St. <hi>Martin</hi> inſpire the King with the deſign
of driving away the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> Has there been any
proofs produced of it? No certainly; Mounſieur St.
<hi>Martin,</hi> does not he wipe away all ſuſpition which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61112:42"/>
the moſt jealous of men could have of him? In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting
as he is a Man of Honour, that the Diſcourſe
which he had with the King was deſigned only to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
him from his deſign of Maſſacring all the <hi>Engliſh:</hi>
But it may be the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are ſuſpected becauſe the
impoſſibility of gueſſing at the reaſon of the Kings
diſpleaſure, gave occaſion to the conjectures. But
how can it be ſaid, after that the King had complained
to all the world that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had aſſiſted his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and after a cloud of Witneſſes had confirmed
the ſame thing, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> themſelves will not
be able to deny, if they will be pleaſed to give any
heed to what one of their own people has written in
a Book Printed here in <hi>London;</hi> where giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all that happened at <hi>Bantam</hi> in the time of
the War, and whereof he had himſelf been an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs,
who ſayes, he believed that the greateſt
part of the Cannon ſhot which were ſhot againſt the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Bantam,</hi> were ſhot by the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> But
in this he was very much miſtaken, for the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
had poſted themſelves then before the Town only to
wait for an Anſwer from the Old King to the offer of
the Mediation of the Government of <hi>Batavia,</hi> and
not in the leaſt to hurt any one; becauſe they knew
that thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation (thoſe are the very
words) had furniſhed the King with almoſt all his
Ammunition of War, and that they had animated the
<hi>Javans</hi> againſt them, <hi>viz.</hi> (againſt the <hi>Hollanders</hi>)
from whence it is eaſie, adds he, to conclude that we
cannot much reckon upon their Friendſhip if they
land. This is a ſincere Confeſſion of what is ſo much
denyed at preſent.</p>
            <p>The fourth Article of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Sweetings</hi> Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
contains two things: Firſt, That there was
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61112:43"/>
taken from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> their Horſes and other Goods,
and that they were forced to unlade their Powder,
and to carry it on ſhoar. Secondly, That the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
which kept guard on the Port hindred them from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, ſince it is not ſaid, much leſs proved,
that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> took away the Horſes and other
Goods from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor that they had forced them
to land their Powder; the Subſcribers will ſpare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the pains of making remarks upon what does
not concern them; and of which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are
diſcharged by the Memorial annexed to the Demand;
which Memorial charges with this (expreſly) the Young
King of <hi>Bantams</hi> Chief Officers: Only in relation to
the Powder, they ſay, that if it be true that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> were forced by the Kings Order to diſpoſe of
it, it was not becauſe the King had need of it, but
becauſe he feared they would have furniſhed his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
with Ammunition.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Hollanders</hi> hindred
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from going out of <hi>Bantam;</hi> There is no
likely hood that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſhould have hindered
the going out of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſince they were invited
there with their Ships to tranſport their Perſons and
Goods from <hi>Bantam</hi> to <hi>Batavia.</hi> Let it be added,
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> made their complaint to the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Major, and that he had anſwered, (mocking them,
as it is ſaid in the fifth Article of the aforeſaid Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition)
that all this was done by the Kings Order, and
it ſignifies nothing. For although the ſaid Major (we
not granting he did) ſhould anſwer, (not to mock
them but ſeriouſly) that however they muſt require
ſatisfaction from the King, though his Orders ſhould
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61112:43"/>
be put in Execution by <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers (but this he has
alwayes firmly deny'd, and whereof there are no
proofs) All this however makes nothing againſt the
<hi>Hollanders;</hi> who, let the Caſe be how it would, were
not reſponſible for the King's Orders.</p>
            <p>That which is added in the ſame Article, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the <hi>French</hi> Chief demanding of the King the Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of two Cheſts of Silver which had been taken
from him: The King anſwered that he knew nothing
of that of which they complained: And that afterwards
he ſent him to thoſe of <hi>Batavia</hi> to have Reparation,
makes nothing againſt thoſe of the Government of <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
ſince the King did thus, it may be to rid himſelf of
the trouble of the <hi>French</hi> Agent's Complaints, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
knew very well himſelf (as it appears by
the Relation of Commander <hi>Tack,</hi> and by the Letter
which is inſerted in it,) That it was one of the King's
Officers which had ſeized upon his Cheſts.</p>
            <p>The 6<hi>th</hi> Article containing that the 11<hi>th April,</hi> 1682,
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers came into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companyes
Godongs, plundering and carrying away all that they
found in it, has no appearance of truth; not only becauſe
it is far from any likelyhood, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having
carryed away and laden all their Goods, even to the
ſmalleſt trifles upon their Ships to tranſport them to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia;</hi>
the day before their departure (for they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the 12<hi>th April,</hi> as they ſay themſelves) there ſhould
be any thing found in their Houſe of the leaſt value; but
alſo becauſe, during their ſtay at <hi>Batavia,</hi> which was
long enough, they never made any Complaint nor ever
delivered any note of what the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſoldiers had robb'd
them of at <hi>Bantam:</hi> Wherefore we ought to conclude
it is a ſtory made at pleaſure, or that they left nothing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61112:44"/>
in their Houſe but Raggs, and the Refuſe of their
Houſhold Stuff.</p>
            <p>As to the Seventh and laſt Article of the ſaid Mr.
<hi>Sweeting's</hi> Depoſition ſpeaking of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours,
the Subſcribers to ſpare your Excellencies the trouble
of hearing Repetitions, will have recourſe (with your
permiſſion) to the remarks which they have made upon
Mr. <hi>John Fiſher's</hi> Depoſition marked <hi>N.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>The Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Waite</hi> marked <hi>N.</hi> 6. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
nothing in ſubſtance but what has been ſworn
by Mr. <hi>Sweeting,</hi> does not deſerve any new Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
excepting the Fourth Article; of which it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to diſcover the Malignity and the Artifice.
When the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Waite</hi>) ſaw themſelves in
ſo great a danger, eſpecially when they knew that ſome
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Officers endeavoured to ſuborn Witneſſes,
(as it was related to the Agent, by thoſe whom they
endeavoured to corrupt;) and when they ſaw that a
<hi>Dutch</hi> Lieutenant came with Soldiers to ſeal up the
Warehouſes in their Factory, and that they did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take from them their Horſes and Goods, but that
they did alſo make them by force bring and deliver
out of their Ships, the Powder belonging to them,
they put on Board what they could gather up of
Goods and Effects in this confuſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Of what uſe would the Witneſſes have been
which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Officers would have ſuborned? pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
to prove that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had aſſiſted the young
King's Rebels: But did not the young King know it
himſelf? And had not he been a Spectator of it? Was
it neceſſary to ſuborn Witneſſes to prove a truth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt?
And things which have been acted in the ſight
of all the World? But yet thoſe Perſons themſelves
whom they had endeavoured to corrupt, had related it
to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Agent. This is a new method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61112:44"/>
that which is urged with ſo much boldneſs. Such
a one has related ſuch a thing to ſuch a one, without
nameing either the one or the other; by this way one
may eaſily diſpatch an Affair without the leaſt trouble.</p>
            <p>That which he ſayes afterwards of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
which ſealed up the Companyes Warehouſes, is
a miſtake, of which it has been formerly ſpoken; where
we ſhewed that <hi>James De Roy</hi> was never a <hi>Dutch</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
but that he was in the ſervice of the young
King of <hi>Bantam</hi> in the time of the War, having ſome
time before fled from <hi>Batavia</hi> to <hi>Bantam</hi> to ſhelter
himſelf from his Creditors.</p>
            <p>That which he adds concerning the Horſes and other
Goods which were taken away from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
naming the Authors of, it ſhows cunning, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
the deſign of ſuſpecting the <hi>Hollanders</hi> (under am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous
Expreſſions) for things of which they knew
them not to be guilty: For the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies
Deputies ſay themſelves in the Memorial which they
have annexed to their Demand, and which make one
part of it, That it was <hi>Pengran Deepa Panerat,</hi> one of
the young King's Chief Miniſters, who cauſed all the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies Horſes to be delivered to him, and
divers other things which he carryed away with him,
as it has been obſerved before.</p>
            <p>The laſt Affidavit marked <hi>N.</hi> 7, is that of <hi>Ambroſe
Moody,</hi> wherein there is neither Rhime nor Reaſon, a
perfect Rhapſody of all ſorts of Facts heaped one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another, and that which is yet more admirable, is
the credulity of the good man who makes Oath, That
all and every of the Articles contained in his Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are true; and who notwithſtanding confeſſes
that there are ſome of them which he affirms only upon
the Relations he has had from Eye-witneſſes, without
making any diſtinction between thoſe he ſays he has
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61112:45"/>
ſeen himſelf, and thoſe he believes upon the Credit of
credible Perſons. And although the Subſcribers might
diſpenſe themſelves from making any reflection upon a
Depoſition of this Nature, yet they will give themſelves
the trouble of running it over, and making the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
upon it which they think are proper.</p>
            <p>That which he ſayes in the beginning concerning
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers which came to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory,
and their taking away ſeveral things, deſerves no
particular mark to be made upon it, ſince the ſame
Complaints have been anſwered before; to which we
refer with the permiſſion of your Excellencies, and he
being ſingular, and to be reproached for what he adds
concerning the Twelve Soldiers, and of what they
robb'd him of, one ſhould be very ill adviſed to give
credit to what he ſwears in his own Caſe.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Hollanders</hi> kept him a Priſoner at <hi>Bantam,</hi>
is very unlikely; but that having rendred himſelf ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious
to the young King by his ſtay at the old <hi>Sultan's</hi>
Court in ſo nice and tickliſh a conjuncture, he might be
clapt up by Authority from the young King, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.</p>
            <p>That which he ſayes of the Plunder which the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
had in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory, is not likely, the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> never having complained of it at <hi>Batavia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the old <hi>Sultan</hi> might ſay at <hi>Tartiaſſa</hi> (although
we believe nothing of it) and what the ſaid <hi>Moody</hi> ſayes
of a Treaty between the Old and the Young King (of
which we never heard) does not in the leaſt concern
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>That which he ſayes of the Maſtery of the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
at <hi>Bantam,</hi> are made ſtories; it being very remote
from any likelyhood of Truth, That the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
ſhould have there made Laws and raiſed Taxes. But
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61112:45"/>
this man having no diſcernment, and that beſides he
appears very much incenſed againſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> he
was deſirous to imbitter things.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſeized upon the <hi>Bantam</hi> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
Letters can never be proved: But it may on
the contrary be proved, that ſometimes the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Companies Letters had been opened.</p>
            <p>As to what he ſayes of the Articles which the King
of <hi>Bantam</hi> was not willing to ſign, we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
what he means, ſince there is a Treaty between
the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> and the Government of <hi>Batavia,</hi>
ſigned by both Parties.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſhould have put into the King's
Head the deſign of forcing out of his Country all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans,
Indians, Mahometans;</hi> (what a folly is this,
the King himſelf being a <hi>Mahometan?) Gentues</hi> and
<hi>Chineſes,</hi> are groſs Calumnies, as it is alſo one, that
the young King at the inſtigation of the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
keeps his Father in the narroweſt Priſon, giving him
his food through an hole which ſerved inſtead of a
Window; ſince it is evident that the Old King ſees
ſometimes Company, and even Strangers, and that
he receives reſpects from them.</p>
            <p>The Subſcribers after having made their Remarks
upon the Proofs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company, whereof
the greateſt part contain nothing of Eſſential, or
which deſerves pauſing upon, deſire at preſent the
Gentlemen of the ſaid Company to conſider, ſince the
Succours given to a lawful Prince oppreſſed by his
Subjects, was very juſt, and that it can never be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that the Government of <hi>Batavia</hi> made the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
between the Father and the Son; nor perſwaded
the laſt either directly or indirectly to drive the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
out of his Country, how unjuſt it is, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
their Generoſity to urge againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:61112:46"/>
Company either invented Stories or Trifles, which
conclude nothing, and which are not ſtrong enough
to uphold a Demand of the importance of that which
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company makes.</p>
            <p>But the Subſcribers having made it their buſineſs hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
only to examine the Nature of the Pretenſions
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company, and to make Obſervations
upon all their Proofes:</p>
            <p>There remains only to run over all the Paragraphs
or Articles of the Demand, upon which there has yet
been no Reflection made; for although theſe Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs
contain only Facts which are inſerted in the
Demand rather in form of a Narrative, than with the
deſign of making Depoſitions of them which they
would be obliged to prove; The Subſcribers cannot
however diſpenſe themſelves from making this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
upon them, becauſe paſſing them under ſilence,
they would increaſe the impreſſions which the ſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
may have made upon the Minds of your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company ſay in
the firſt Paragraph of their Demand, That the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
ſince the Invaſion of <hi>Bantam,</hi> have not only
Obſtructed, but Hoſtilely Invaded our Trade, and
ſhot at our Servants with Bullets on the Coaſt of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labar,</hi>
to deterr and beat them off from that little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
we had there of the <hi>Pepper</hi> Trade.</p>
            <p>To which the Subſcribers Anſwer, That the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Company having taken from the <hi>Portugals</hi> when they
had War with them, the Towns and Forts which
they poſſeſt on the Coaſt of <hi>Malabar,</hi> It was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
for the ſaid Company to enjoy the Advantages
of their Victory, with excluding of all thoſe who
without having ſhared with them in the Charges and
Dangers of the War, pretend to a ſhare in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61112:46"/>
although they have the Trade of all the North
part of <hi>Malabar</hi> free and open, where is a great deal
of <hi>Pepper,</hi> and where the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company hath very
little or no Trade, and which produce much greater
profit to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company without being at any
Charge of keeping Towns and Forts. That the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
aſſaulted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fireing upon them (as it is
ſaid in this Article:) The Subſcribers proteſt they knew
nothing of it, and that they do not even believe any
thing of it ſince the Letters from <hi>Batavia</hi> make no
mention of it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Article ſpeaking of the Money which
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company had lent to the Young King of
<hi>Bantam,</hi> and with which the Fort was built, is a thing
does not in the leaſt concern the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, and
of which they know nothing. Beſides, That when
they make up their Accompts with the King of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi>
he will diſcharge himſelf of his Debts by a juſt
Compenſation.</p>
            <p>The third Paragraph making mention of an Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
(which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company abhors,) ſhews a
great inclination to Suſpition and Jealouſie, which
ought to be baniſht from the Mind, to re-eſtabliſh a
good Underſtanding between the two Companyes.</p>
            <p>The fourth Article is a <hi>Dilemma</hi> couched in theſe
Terms: <q>Becauſe if the Old King of <hi>Bantam</hi> had a
Right to <hi>Bantam,</hi> and to the Territories thereof, they
are now His Majeſties by his Donation of them to the
late King of ever bleſſed Memory. If the Right
thereof lyes (as the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſay) in the Young King,
He hath been ſo inhumane and ungrateful, and bloody
an Enemy to His Majeſties Subjects confeſſedly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt Cauſe or Provocation on their Parts, that
we humbly conceive His Majeſties Honour cannot be
repaired without invading his City and Country; and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61112:47"/>
the rather becauſe though he be called a King, he
is in Truth none; but a perfect Slave to the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavians,</hi>
and an Executioner of their Will and
Pleaſure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt fork of this Argument, becauſe it is
evident, that the Old King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> having reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
His Kingdom to his eldeſt Son, could not give it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to any other; ſo that the inference which
ought to be made from it, is againſt the Engliſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>As for the ſecond part of the Dilemma, <hi>viz.</hi> If this
Right belongs to the Young King, and that it be true
that he hath been ſo inhumane, ingrateful and bloody
an Enemy to His Majeſties Subjects without the leaſt
provocation: One may indeed inferr a great deal from
it, but nothing which can ſupport the demand of the
Engliſh Company, from That of <hi>Holland:</hi> As there
can be nothing inferred from it, againſt the Young
King of <hi>Bantam;</hi> if for good Reaſon (as he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
he has) he ſhewed his reſentment againſt the
<hi>Engliſh.</hi> But it muſt be obſerved here (by the by)
that when they are to reproach the Young King, they
ſay, he has been an inhumane, ungrateful, and bloody
Enemy to His Majeſties Subjects, without the leaſt
cauſe or provocation. But when the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are to
be charged, and to make them paſs for the Authors of
the expulſion of the Engliſh from <hi>Bantam,</hi> the langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
is changed, and it is ſaid that there could not be
obſerved either in the Kings looks or words, the leaſt
thing which ſhewed any reſentment againſt, or that he
had any deſign of turning them out of his Countrey.</p>
            <p>The Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Articles have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
before.</p>
            <p>Of the Seventh, The Gentlemen of the Dutch
Company never knew nor believe any thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:61112:47"/>
To the Eighth it is anſwered, That the Young
King was perſwaded (as it appears by <hi>Tack's</hi> Relation
marked O. and that of <hi>Heinſius</hi> marked N.) that all
thoſe which he had drove out of his Countrey had
aſſiſted his Enemies.</p>
            <p>Thus is the Apology of the Dutch Company finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Engliſh Companies Demands deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>There remains now nothing more but to relate in a
word the Demands of the Dutch Company, for
the Hire of their Ships of which the Gentlemen of the
Engliſh Company at <hi>Bantam</hi> (promiſing to pay
the Freight) made uſe of to Tranſport their perſons
and Effects from thence to <hi>Batavia,</hi> and which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
were made uſe of inſtead of Magazines, to the
great dammage of the Dutch Company who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
them to be returned to them, to carry their own
Merchandize.</p>
            <p>The Ships which the Gentlemen of the Engliſh
Company uſed, are theſe following.</p>

            <p>1. WE ſhould admire at the Voluminouſneſs of
the Deputies for the Dutch <hi>Eaſt-India-Companies</hi>
Anſwer (eſpecially conſidering how valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Your Lordſhips time is,) But that looking back for
many years paſt, we find it is one of the Old Artifices
of that Company, to hide or confound the truth by a
multitude of eloquent but vain words, as Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
may have obſerved in the Records of all former
Tranſactions and Complaints of the ſame Nature, as
this is now of <hi>Bantam;</hi> in moſt whereof they have
been judged formerly, to pay great ſums of Money to
the <hi>Eaſt-India-Company,</hi> which they did pay accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly:
But we could never hear or read that the Dutch
Company reſtored to the Engliſh any place of Trade,
that ever they deprived them of by fraud or violence.</p>
            <p>2. We affirm to Your Lordſhips, that we never
gave any Order or Liberty to Sir <hi>John Chardin</hi> before,
or at his late being in <hi>Holland,</hi> but enjoyned him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to keep ſtrictly to the Demands of His late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61112:49"/>
of glorious memory, in his ſaid Majeſties letter &amp;
memorial: For the proof of which aſſertion we here will
preſent Your Lordſhips, Copies of all our Letters and
Orders to him: And if Sir <hi>John</hi> entered upon any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
or Articles, other then what was contained in
His Majeſties ſaid Memorial and Letter, through the
perſwaſion of the Dutch <hi>Bewinthebers,</hi> or otherwiſe,
he is now here and muſt make his own juſtification, we
being perfectly unconcerned in any thing he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to His late Majeſties, or our own inſtructions.</p>
            <p>3dly. For the Negotiation that was afterward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this affair, with the late Lord Ambaſſador Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Van Citters,</hi> we referre our ſelves to the ſaid
Ambaſſadors Long Memorial, and our Anſwer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
preſented Your Lordſhips; by which the truth,
Regularity and Juſtice of His Majeſties <hi>Eaſt-India-Company</hi>
will appear to Your Lordſhips above all
contradiction.</p>
            <p>4thly. To the Dutch Deputies queſtion, <hi>cui bono,</hi> what
profit the Dutch could make by exciting the Young
King to quarrel with his Father, and the conſequences
that might happen thereupon: We ſay, we cannot
but think it very ſtrange, that ſuch experienced learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Gentlemen, ſhould propound ſo ſlight a queſtion to
ſuch a wiſe Tribunal as Your Lordſhips; which the
ſimpleſt Sailer either Engliſh or Dutch, that ever was
in <hi>India</hi> can reſolve <hi>Extempore. Bantam</hi> was a Port
to which all <hi>European</hi> Nations Trading in <hi>India,</hi> and
moſt of the Natives did reſort with Ships richly loaden,
to the number of above forty yearly: And the <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians</hi>
by cauſing that poor ſimple man, (they yet call
King) whom they will not truſt with a Knife, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
all thoſe Nations from his Port, have thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed
to themſelves in effect the whole Trade of the
South-Seas; and had thereby fair hopes of Engroſſing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61112:49"/>
the whole Trade of <hi>Pepper;</hi> as their people in <hi>India</hi> have
often boaſted they would: And it is moſt apparent they
deſigned it, by the hoſtilities they have ſince perpetrated
againſt the Engliſh and other Nations of <hi>India,</hi> upon the
Coaſt of <hi>Mallabar;</hi> which Engroſſement if they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
as by like arts they have the other Spices, Cloves,
Mace, Cinamon and Nutmegs, they might gain ſufficient
by that ſole Commodity, to maintain conſtantly a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
in <hi>Europe</hi> ſtrong enough to fight any Royal Navy.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Their next queſtion, How it can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Young King of <hi>Bantam</hi> ſhould be ſo ſimple,
as to enſlave himſelf and his poſterity; We ſhall
reſolve, when they tell us by what ſlights the
<hi>Batavians,</hi> with pitiful inconſiderable Forces have
enſlaved and held in ſlavery above Fifty ſuch Kings
within Eighty years paſt in thoſe Eaſtern parts of the
World. It will be enough at preſent to tell Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips;
The Princes and people of thoſe parts are
a naked people, unuſed to fire-Arms, that live in the
innocent primitive eſtate of Nature, without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
the guiles of the Dutch <hi>Eaſt-India-Company,</hi>
until they have built a Fort, and then the
Princes themſelves as well as their ſubjects, muſt
immediately become down-right Slaves to the Dutch;
and its too late to repent without the hazard of
being all cut off, Man, Woman and Child; which
was lately the Fate of one of the <hi>Javan</hi> Princes
in the Eaſtern parts of that Iſland, and of his
people; wherein an Engliſh Fugitive Captain <hi>Cooper,</hi>
was ſaid to be employed by them in the execution.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, We herewith preſent Your Lordſhips the
Articles, Printed at <hi>Batavia,</hi> made at <hi>Macaſſar</hi> for
the Excluſion of the Engliſh and other Nations, from
the Trade of that place; for which never any ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was made the <hi>Engliſh Company.</hi> Our end therein is
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61112:50"/>
not to make the breach wider between the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
(of which they ſeem groundleſly to accuſe us,)
but to ſhew Your Lordſhips the ſame Tragedy that
was acted at <hi>Bantam,</hi> with little alteration, except
changing the Scene; wherein ſuch an Ocean of humane
blood was ſpilt, and in ſuch a manner (with a little
fighting, and after ſubmiſſion) as we are not willing
to mention; and is not to be parallel'd in any Hiſtory
we have Read; of which there are living Witneſſes
that were preſent at the action, which we can produce
to Your Lordſhips, but that we are not willing to ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate
or trouble Your Lordſhips with what is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to the preſent caſe of <hi>Bantam:</hi> Yet this uſe we
muſt beg Your Lordſhips leave to make of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of <hi>Macaſſar,</hi> that ſince no ſatisfaction has been
made to the Engliſh, for that important place; Your
Lordſhips would be pleaſed to take and keep a ſtrong
hold of our juſt claim to <hi>Bantam;</hi> that we may not be
totally deprived of a place of reſt and ſecurity in the
South-Seas, (where the Dutch have above Thirty Forts)
to the irreparable ſhame and reproach of our Nation.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The proofs we have exhibited to your
Lordſhips are ſo expreſs to the matter of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
that moſt of them do prove <hi>in terminis</hi> the
things complained of, and the Witneſſes are not only
<hi>fide digni,</hi> but Men of good Fortunes, and approved
exemplary Veracity; and we do not only believe
what all of them have ſworn, and particularly Mr.
<hi>Moody,</hi> but much more, (which they have told us) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the many years contrivances, and horrible
wicked methods that were uſed by the <hi>Batavians,</hi> to
create thoſe unnatural quarrels between the Father
and the Son; which we have omitted to trouble your
Lordſhips with, becauſe they could not atteſt them
upon their own knowledge, as we have likewiſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61112:50"/>
omitted (for the ſame reaſon) ſome Letters of the
Old King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> wherein he wrote to his late
Majeſty long before the ſurprize of <hi>Bantam,</hi> that the
<hi>Dutch</hi> were contriving to enſlave him and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as they had done all his Neighbour Princes; but
that he would be ſlave to none but to his late Majeſty
of Glorious Memory.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, What the ſaid <hi>Dutch</hi> Deputies ſay in
extenuation of the Hoſtilities committed by their
people upon the Coaſt of <hi>Malabarr,</hi> is ſo wide from
any excuſe of that crime, and breach of the peace
between the two Nations, that it ſeems to us to be a
plain confeſſion of what they have been ſo often and
ſo juſtly accuſed of, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that they deſign not only
by their old arts of ſetting <hi>Indian</hi> Princes at War,
and making themſelves partakers in the quarrel to
enſlave both parties, and then compel their partners
to drive the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of their Country: But that
now having got ſo great a poſt for their purpoſe as
<hi>Bantam,</hi> they are become impatient of truſting to
their old ſlow methods, and are reſolved to finiſh that
engroſsment of <hi>Pepper</hi> at once, <hi>Vi &amp; Armis:</hi> For one
of your Lordſhips may remember that ſoon after the
firſt News came to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court of the <hi>Batavians</hi>
action at <hi>Bantam,</hi> Mr. <hi>Van Damm</hi> (a ruling man in
their Committee) wrote to a Friend of his then in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
to acquaint the Lords of His Majeſties Council,
that he did for himſelf and all the ſeventeen, (which
is their whole Committee) diſclaim that wicked act as
(we remember) he called it, that <hi>Spelman</hi> had done at
<hi>Bantam:</hi> which now ſince they were ſo prevalent (by
promiſe of doing right in the fair way of a Treaty)
to cauſe His late Majeſty to divert that Warlike Fleet
that was deſigned for the recovery of <hi>Bantam</hi> two
years paſt; they have arrived at the conſidence not
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61112:51"/>
only to juſtifie that wicked act, but to tell your
Lordſhips (in effect) that they have made the ſame
termes with the poor enſlaved Creature they call the
King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> as they did make with the enſlaved
<hi>Macaſſars;</hi> and that they would make ſuch terms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive
to the <hi>Engliſh, French, Danes, &amp;c.</hi> ſome of
your Lordſhips may pleaſe to remember we told
your Lordſhips formerly they would do; which any
perſon, knowing the <hi>Dutch</hi> and the affairs of <hi>India,</hi>
might eaſily have foreſeen, without pretending to the
gift of Prophecy, which they upbraid us with: And
for their juſtifying or defending, (as they term it)
their expelling us from <hi>Bantam,</hi> we will undertake
at the hazard of our Credit with His Majeſty and
your Lordſhips, (which is very dear to us) to prove
in their own preſence before your Lordſhips by irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable
Arguments, that if that defence which they
have made ſhall be admitted good by your Lordſhips,
they may with eaſe and certainty expel us from
every Port and place in <hi>India</hi> where we have not
Guns and Men enough to beat them off. And if your
Lordſhips, or the Deputies themſelves, will nominate
any Port or places in <hi>India</hi> particularly to be diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before your Lordſhips, (be they many or few,)
we will demonſtrate to your Lordſhips that they may
eaſily expel us particularly from each nominated place
by the ſame or ſuch like methods as they uſed at <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi>
and juſtifie their ſo doing by better Arguments
than they have or can urge for what they have done
at <hi>Bantam:</hi> So that though they pretend ſo much for
Peace, if they be ſincere in their pretences, it is
ſuch a Peace as ſhall leave them alone in the whole
fruition of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade; for otherwiſe by
their own Hypotheſis, (which is in ſubſtance, that they
may make any treaty with the Native Princes of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:61112:51"/>
though to the prejudice of the Subjects of the
Kings in amity with them in <hi>Europe;</hi>) the two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are now and muſt continue in a ſtate of War in
<hi>India,</hi> though we are not in actual Hoſtility; or elſe
we and all other <hi>Europeans</hi> muſt quietly yield them
the ſole Trade of thoſe Eaſtern parts of the World;
except only thoſe few places where we have Forts
ſtrong enough to defend our ſelves, againſt not their
Forces only, but theirs conjunctive with all <hi>Indian</hi>
Nations that they have enſlaved, or can draw into
their confederacy.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, To what the ſaid Deputies ſay, that
ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> were found among the ſlain of the Old
King of <hi>Bantam</hi>'s party; we ſay, that in truth we
do not know or believe there was one man: But if
there were two or three renegado <hi>Engliſh,</hi> (ſervants
to the Old King) it concerns not the Company, nor
would be any News eſpecially to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
whoſe Seamen and Souldiers run away by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
into the <hi>Moors,</hi> and other Natives ſervice year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Their charge likewiſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> robbing their
houſes at <hi>Bantam,</hi> is as ridiculous, falſe, and impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as circumſtances then ſtood with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for
after the <hi>Dutch</hi> were landed, it was immediately given
out that all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould be Maſſacred that night;
which our ſervants (remembring too well what had
formerly been done in <hi>Amboina</hi> and the <hi>Eaſtern Iſlands</hi>)
were in eminent fear of for two days and two nights
together; and had enough to do to meditate and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
themſelves for preſent Death, although (by what
followed) they ſince believe, that bloody report was
given out artificially and purpoſely to terrifie them;
that as ſoon as the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould think fit to order their
Slave the young King to command the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge,
they ſhould do it readily, with ſuch a thankful
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61112:52"/>
Letter as Mr. <hi>Sweeting</hi> carried, or any other thanks;
which the ſtouteſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being unarmed, after
ſuch a fright, would not have refuſed to ſubſcribe.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, If your Lordſhips ſhould object, that if
the <hi>Batavians</hi> can ſo eaſily deprive us of all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of our Trade in <hi>India,</hi> and that they are ſo
avaritious and unjuſt as we affirm them to be; how
comes it to paſs that we have any part of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Trade left us? We anſwer, that we ſuppoſe
the reaſon why they deprive us not of all preſently,
is for fear of that word that troubles them ſo much;
(<hi>viz.</hi>) if they ſhould proceed <hi>per Saltum,</hi> it would
make a great noiſe in <hi>Europe,</hi> (as they ſay we have
made about this buſineſs of <hi>Bantam</hi>) and are the more
angry at it, becauſe they have been ſo fortunate in
ſhifting off many other aggreſſions which they have
made upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation: Particularly their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
us from that important place of <hi>Macaſſar,</hi> for
which they never made ſatisfaction by any Treaty,
as aforeſaid. But they muſt conſider, (as we doubt not
but your Lordſhips will) that they have drove us now
to the Wall, and neceſſity will make a Coward valiant:
We muſt be reſtored to <hi>Bantam,</hi> or for ever bid adieu
to the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Trade; and in a little time more
(when the noiſe that troubles them is over) to all the
Trade of <hi>India:</hi> The methods of their proceedings
in all ſuch encroachments upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in all times
having been to make one bold ſtep, and then ſpend
thirteen or fourteen years in allaying the noiſe of that,
or paying for it not the hundredth part of what the
concernment of it is worth to this Kingdom: And
when the noiſe of that is well allayed or bought off in
<hi>Europe,</hi> then to make a new encroachment; ſo they
began at <hi>Japan</hi> and <hi>Amboyna;</hi> and ſince that deceived
us of <hi>Pollaroon</hi> and <hi>Polloway;</hi> then of <hi>Dam</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſar,</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:61112:52"/>
and laſtly of <hi>Bantam;</hi> moving ſtill from the
<hi>Eaſt Weſterly,</hi> to lay their Purchaſes together (for we
cannot call them Conqueſts) And without doubt when
this noiſe is over, the next place they will expell us
from ſhall be <hi>Bengal</hi> and the Coaſt of <hi>Mallabar,</hi> (as
their own Director or Chief of <hi>Bengal</hi> hath publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared) And then our buſineſs in thoſe parts of the
World will be compleatly finiſhed. This, my Lords,
is our Caſe, and muſt be our Fortune, if we muſt ſee
our ſelves deſtroyed, the nobleſt Navigation of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
ruined, and conſequently our King and Country
diſhonoured, with our hands tyed behind us, ſo as
not to be permitted to right our ſelves, without being
unjuſtly charged (as the Lyon did the Lamb in the
Fable) as if we were Men affecting Wars, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
Diſſenſion between the two Nations: An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
that we diſown and abhor, having been in all
times more averſe to Armes, than did conſiſt with our
Intereſt and Duty, out of the too great inclination we
had to Peace and Quietneſs.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, And whereas the Gentlemen are pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to inſinuate, that though the pretended young King
of <hi>Bantam</hi> be never ſo mean, their Faith ought to be
kept with him as much as if he were the greateſt King
upon Earth; which we deny not, but ſay, they had
firſt plighted their Faith to our Deceaſed Sovereign of
Glorious Memory, in the laſt Treaty of Peace, which
they have violated by thoſe injurious Articles they
have made with the enſlaved King of <hi>Bantam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Twelfthly, If the <hi>Batavians</hi> have kept their terms
with that enſlaved Prince of <hi>Bantam,</hi> (which we have
reaſon not to believe they have) it is the firſt time
that ever we heard they have kept their Faith with
any of thoſe poor ignorant Natives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:61112:53"/>
Thirteenthly, If they have made any Articles with
that poor King, they were made while he was a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouer
within the Fort, in a moſt abject Thraldom to
the <hi>Dutch;</hi> in which condition the poor man would as
readily ſet his hand to any thing the <hi>Batavians</hi> would
have him, as our ſervants ſubſcribed the Letter before
mentioned. And ſuch is certainly his condition, that
the poor Creature, if <hi>Bantam</hi> be delivered to the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> will be ſo far from upbraiding the <hi>Batavians</hi>
with breach of Faith for that cauſe, that he will look
upon it as the only good turn that ever they did him
in his life, for then he may be ſure of his Liberty,
and hope to be a little King upon the Hills, or in the
Woods, and at worſt ſee his Subjects flouriſh under
the mild Government of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> whereas in his
preſent condition, with the total loſs of his little Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
he muſt live in durance, under the anxiety of
ſeeing his Country ruinated and depopulated.</p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, For the juſtification of our Demands
of Dammages, or to leſſen or invalidate what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of us by the Gentlemen Subſcribers; we
ſhall trouble your Lordſhips with no Diſcourſe at
preſent, becauſe we deſire not to enter upon that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
till <hi>Bantam</hi> be reſtored to us; neither ſhall we
trouble your Lordſhips with any Paraphraſe upon the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Papers, offered for Evidence upon the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
Eaſt-India</hi> Companies part; becauſe few of
them are upon Oath, and none of them (as we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend)
to any purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Fifteenthly, There are ſome few particulars in the
ſaid Deputies anſwer that we have not replyed unto,
being in our judgments (to uſe their own phraſe) meer
trifles; but if your Lordſhips ſhall think any thing of
moment unanſwered, upon your Lordſhips command
we ſhall make a farther and particular anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:61112:53"/>
Sixteenthly, What the Gentlemen mean by their
triumphant concluſion, that they have overthrown our
pretenſions, and juſtified that wicked act of <hi>Bantam,</hi>
we underſtand not, except it be a form of concluding
litigious Papers in <hi>Holland.</hi> Our Concluſion ſhall be
no more, but to aſſure your Lordſhips that we have a
perfect confidence in your Lordſhips Juſtice, and
therefore we cannot doubt but our preſent Sovereigns
moſt auſpicious Reign ſhall be ſignaliz'd, by having
one place of importance in <hi>India,</hi> that his Subjects
were unjuſtly deprived of, reſtored again to them in
his time, which never was done in the time of any of

            <p>THe underwritten Deputies of the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi>
Company being deſirous not to engage
in a fight of Calumnies, from which the Conquerour
can reap nothing but ſhame and confuſion; inſtead of
returning the like to the Gentlemen of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Company, will apply themſelves ſolely to demonſtrate
in this replication, that the Reply, far from having
undermined the foundation of the Anſwer, has not ſo
much as touched it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners having highly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in their demand, that on the behalf of the High
and Mighty Lords the States General, and of that of
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company: It was agreed that reſtitution
(as they call it) of <hi>Bantam</hi> ſhould be made into His
Majeſties hands: The underwritten, before they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into the diſcuſſion of the principal cauſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61112:54"/>
of this preliminary point (<hi>quaeſtio pre judicialis</hi>)
had proved two things.</p>
            <p>I. That touching the Reſtitution of <hi>Bantam,</hi> there
was nothing concluded nor ſetled between the two
Companies; and that their High and Mightineſſes were
far from diſpoſing of Towns that did not belong to
them, and to which they had no manner of Right.</p>
            <p>II. And in the ſecond place, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
after the change which happened at <hi>Bantam,</hi>
could not take hold of the Anſwer return'd by their
High and Mightineſſes to Sir <hi>John Chardin</hi>'s Memorial,
no more than of the Advances which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
made in the Year 1683, towards the Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating
the Differences which the War at <hi>Bantam</hi> had
been the cauſe of between the two Companies.</p>
            <p>What do the Gentlemen of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company
reply to this? Nothing at all, but only bring Sir <hi>John
Chardin</hi> upon the Stage very improperly. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
not being what Sir <hi>John Chardin</hi> acted at the
<hi>Hague</hi> upon the matter of <hi>Bantam,</hi> but only whether
the two Companies with the conſent of the <hi>States,</hi> did
agree to the Reſtitution of <hi>Bantam</hi> into the Hands of
His Majeſty; which the underwritten have expreſly
denyed; which was enough to prove that there was
nothing concluded between the ſaid Companies:
Wherefore it may be inferred, ſince the Gentlemen of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company paſs all this under ſilence, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there only of Sir <hi>John Chardin,</hi> that theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
do indirectly detract from what they advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in their Demand touching the Concluſion of the
Reſtitution of <hi>Bantam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company having had in the Capital City
only a Factory and their reſidence, without having made
any pretence there to the leaſt Right of Territory; it
was demanded of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Deputies, with what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61112:55"/>
of Juſtice the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company could pretend
to the Reſtitution of that which they never poſſeſſed,
unto which it had never had any real pretence founded
upon the propriety (<hi>Dominium</hi>) which not only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Civil Law, but alſo according to that of
Nature, ought to be the Ground of a Real Action.</p>
            <p>What do they reply to all this? Nothing at all. The
underwritten after having given (in their Anſwer to
your Excellencies) a true <hi>Idea</hi> of the Affair of <hi>Bantam,</hi>
did afterwards conjure the Gentlemen of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Company to deveſt themſelves of their Prepoſſeſſion,
and to make ſerious Reflection upon the following
Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> having reſigned his
Empire to his Eldeſt Son; the laſt by this Reſignation
became lawful King, and was acknowledged as ſuch
by the late King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> of Glorious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and by thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That being a lawful King, his Subjects
taking Arms to Dethrone him, were Rebels.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That according to the Law of Nature, and
That of Nations, it is not only lawful to aſſiſt a King
oppreſſed by his Rebellious Subjects, but that it alſo
ought to be reputed an Act of Charity.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That it is contrary to the ſame Law to
impute the unhappy conſequences of a lawful and juſt
Action to the Perſon who was Author of the Action,
but not of the Conſequences.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, And that by conſequence there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more contrary to reaſon than to impute, in their
Reply, the Expulſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>Bantam</hi>
to the Regency of <hi>Batavia,</hi> and to their Auxiliary
Arms.</p>
            <p>What do they ſay to all theſe deciſive points? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all. From which ſilence, although it might
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61112:55"/>
be concluded, that the ground of the Anſwer of the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Company remaining ſtill firmand unſhaken, the
pains of refuting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies Reply, (which
can contain nothing Eſſential in it,) the underwritten
notwithſtanding have thought fit to read it over from
one end to the other, and to make upon it the Remarks
which are neceſſary.</p>
            <p>And paſſing over the three firſt Articles of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
in the firſt of which they ſpeak (although very
improperly, and by way of Reproach) of Sums which
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company paid a long time ago to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Eaſt-India</hi> Company, with the proſpect only of
buying Peace: They will begin their Remarks with
the Conſiderations upon the Fourth Article of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
            <p>Coming to the Queſtion of <hi>Cui Bono</hi> of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Deputies (ſay the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners in the ſaid
Fourth Article) that is to ſay, what Advantage the
<hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould have had in exciting the Young King of
<hi>Bantam</hi> to make a Quarrel with his Father, and what
may be the Conſequences of it: We anſwer, (add they)
that we wonder ſuch knowing and experienced Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſhould make ſo pitiful a Queſtion to ſo wiſe a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
as that of your Excellencies, to which the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Sailer <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> which ever had been in
<hi>India,</hi> could anſwer <hi>ex tempore. Bantam</hi> was a Port
to which all <hi>European</hi> Nations, and the greater part of
the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations traded with Ships richly laden, to
the Number of more than Forty every Year (and what
follows to the end of the ſame Article.)</p>
            <p>The underwritten Deputies do not doubt but that
your Excellencies after ſo pitiful a Rhapſody (or <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matias</hi>)
will be pleaſed to allow them to complain of
the little heed which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Deputies give to what
has been ſaid in the Anſwer, and of their terming a
convincing Argument ridiculous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:61112:56"/>
There is only common ſence required, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either wonderful Learned or Experienced, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Deputies have not more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
the Arguments drawn from the end; which
every rational Man propoſes to himſelf in his Actions,
than if it had been writ in <hi>Arabick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The underwritten deſired in their Anſwer (not
your Excellencies, but the Commiſſioners of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Company) to explain to them <hi>cui bono,</hi> and with
what proſpect thoſe at <hi>Batavia</hi> ſhould give themſelves
the trouble of making a Quarrel between the Father
and the Son, and to animate one againſt the other; of
what Uſe that would have been to them, and what
Advantage they would have drawn from it. For ſince
the Son had aſcended the Throne, and that he had
ſignified by his Embaſſadors to the Regency of <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
that he was willing to live in a good Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
with them, and to uſe them more favourably
than his Father had done during his Reign: As alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
thoſe at <hi>Batavia</hi> had no reaſon to complain of his
Behaviour in relation to them; and why then ſhould
they be willing to engage him in a War againſt his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and his own Subjects, and of ſeeing his Father
re-aſcend the Throne, or his younger Brother ſet up
in his ſtead.</p>
            <p>What do the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Deputies reply to this? They
ſay that <hi>Bantam</hi> was a Port to which all the <hi>European</hi>
Nations trading to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and greateſt part of the
<hi>Indian</hi> Nations, traded with Ships richly laden, to the
Number of above Forty every Year; that is to ſay (as
it ought to be Explained in the ſence of theſe Gentle-Men)
that <hi>Bantam</hi> is a Port which would fit the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
very well: Oh the fine Reply! The Queſtion
is not here, Whether the Town of <hi>Bantam</hi> be an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
Port; we agree it is; but the matter is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61112:56"/>
only to know, what Advantage 'twould be to thoſe of
<hi>Batavia,</hi> to excite and foment a War between the
Old and the Young King of <hi>Bantam?</hi> And what was
the Advantage which they could rationally hope to
reap from it? The underwritten deſire the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Deputyes to tell them, what Connexion there would
be, in the Mind of a Rational Man, between ſtirring
up a War between the Old and the Young King, and
the ſeizing upon <hi>Bantam</hi> upon the ſucceſs of this
War? How thoſe of the Regency of <hi>Batavia?</hi> Were
they Diviners and Prophets, and could they, by a
Spirit of Prophecy, penetrate into the ſecrets of futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?
Did they know ſo long before, that the War
would end to the Sons Advantage? That the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
would concern themſelves in it? And that he
would drive them from <hi>Bantam?</hi> Thoſe at <hi>Batavia</hi>
had they not rather cauſe to fear, that the Young Prince
would be overcome in this War? And that his Father
would reaſcend the Throne? As really we ſaw the
Young King within two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngers of his Ruine, and upon
the brink of the Precipice, writing to thoſe of <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
Letters filled with marks of deſpair. Why did
thoſe of <hi>Batavia</hi> (if they had deſigned to kindle a
War between the Father and the Son) give themſelves
the trouble to reconcile and pacify them? Suffering all
this while the Young Prince to ſigh after their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance?
From whence we ought conclude, whatſoever
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen ſay of it, have not comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the ſtrength of this Argument, that it cannot be
ſuppoſed that thoſe at <hi>Batavia</hi> ſhould concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with making a War between the Father and
the Son, without making things deſperate, or without
deſtroying probabilities; which ought even to be kept
in a Romance, that is to ſay in a feigned ſtory made to
divert the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:61112:57"/>
In the Fifth Article of the Reply, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
ſay, That the underwritten Deputies ask them
how it could be imagined that the Young King of
<hi>Bantam</hi> ſhould be ſo ſimple as to put the Fetters on
himſelf and his Poſterity? But it is pleaſant that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen ſhould repreſent the under-written
as making Demands and Queſtions of which they have
not had the leaſt thought. It is true, that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
Demand in their Anſwer, what likelyhood
there was that a Man of common ſence ſhould give ear
to an advice ſo Extravagant, and ſo Dangerous, as
that by which they would have perſwaded the Young
King of <hi>Bantam</hi> to a War againſt his Father, and
againſt his own Subjects: But they have been pleaſed
to invent this Queſtion, that they might anſwer it, as
they have done, with a Torrent of Injuries and Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
with which they tear the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company in the
moſt unjuſt and outraging manner.</p>
            <p>But the underwritten having been able to foreſee
long ſince, that they would have opportunity of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing
their Patience in rendring good for evil; they
would pray to God, that for the good of both the
Companyes, he would be pleaſed to encline the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company to return into the
Paths of Moderation, and of Mildneſs: And as to
the injuries, they would ſay only theſe two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If the Gentlemen of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company
ever take a fancy to write the Hiſtory of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Company in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> from its beginning (to
which theſe Gentlemen have recourſe to this time)
it will be made appear, that either this Hiſtory will
belye all that is ſaid in the Reply, concerning the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving
of fifty <hi>Indian</hi> Kings, and of the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> Or if it confirms all that, it
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61112:57"/>
will be proved that it will be but a terrible Romance
grounded upon ſuppoſed facts; not to divert the
World, (which is the deſign of all the Authors of
Romances) but to blacken the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, and
to render them execrable to the whole Univerſe. But
as it hath pleaſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Deputies to ſet the Town
of <hi>Bantam</hi> in parallel with the other places of the
Uſurpation, of which they complain, and to ſay in
the Tenth Article of their Reply in formal terms,
that the <hi>Dutch</hi> had done as much to them at <hi>Bantam,</hi>
as in the other places they have uſurped: It is evident
that all their injurious Complaints muſt vaniſh into
ſmoak ſo ſoon as by the reading of the Anſwer, and
the proofs of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, it will appear that
the Regency of <hi>Batavia</hi> has done nothing at <hi>Bantam,</hi>
neither towards the King nor the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company,
which was not very juſt and equitable: For although
ſince the difference between the Companies concerning
the affairs of <hi>Bantam,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen have
been pleaſed to rally (although very ungratefully)
the King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> and to call him a poor and piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Slave, and a Priſoner to <hi>Batavia,</hi> notwithſtanding
the honour which was done to his Embaſſadors here
in <hi>London,</hi> in the year 1682. 'Tis notwithſtanding
true that thoſe of the Regency of <hi>Batavia</hi> have uſed
this <hi>Indian</hi> Prince in ſo charitable, and at the ſame
time in ſo generous a manner, that very far from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ever complained of their proceedings towards
him, he has on the contrary highly commended
them.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore there is a great deal of trouble
ſaved to the Engliſh Gentlemen, and to thoſe of the
Dutch, which may at preſent diſpenſe themſelves
from it; The firſt from juſtifying the bloody reproaches
which they make againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company; and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61112:58"/>
the others from defending themſelves from them in
this replication, which would become a ſecond Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
if they would make it ſwell with a new Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
which is nothing of common with the affair of
<hi>Bantam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Deputies themſelves (after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſuffered themſelves to be carryed away by the
firſt torrent of their Paſſions) have upon better
thoughts, thought fit not to grieve the hearts of your
Excellencies (as they ſpeak) with things which ſignifie
nothing to the preſent Caſe of <hi>Bantam:</hi> (although in
truth they ſay nothing which comes to the ſaid point).
The underwritten will keep themſelves within the
bounds of the preſent Controverſie, without going
out of it, but by an indiſpenſable neceſſity.</p>
            <p>As to the Complaints which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Deputies
have ſo throughout their whole reply, in relation to
the <hi>Dutch</hi> excluſive Contracts with <hi>Indian</hi> Princes;
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company will be very well able to juſtifie,
in time and place, that which it has alwayes main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and which it does ſtill maintain, concerning
the right of the ſaid Contracts.</p>
            <p>The proofs which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to your Excellencies view, as they ſay in the
ſeventh Paragraph of their Reply, very far from being
(as they call them) ſo expreſs upon the point of their
Complaints, and that the greateſt part of them prove
<hi>in terminis</hi> every one of their grievances: It is on the
contrary true, that not one of their proofs makes ſo
much as mention of them: The underwritten deſire
theſe Gentlemen to tell them, by which of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
they can prove, that the Regency of <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
did ever ſtir up and foment a War between the
Old and the Young King of <hi>Bantam;</hi> and that the
<hi>Dutch</hi> expelled (as they call it) the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam;</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:61112:58"/>
for as for having raiſed the War, there is not
one Witneſs ſo much as ſpeaks of it, far from atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. And as to their expulſion from <hi>Bantam,</hi> there
is not one Witneſs which ſwears to have ſeen himſelf,
or to have heard others ſay, that they had ſeen it with
their Eyes, or that they had heard others ſay that
they had ſeen it with theirs; there being only two or
three Witneſſes who endeavour to ground it upon
Arguments and Conjectures, contrary to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of true Witneſſes, who can depoſe nothing
but upon the Teſtimony of their own Senſes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Deputies have not extenuated the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilities
upon the Coaſt of <hi>Mallabar,</hi> for which thoſe
of <hi>Batavia</hi> were accuſed; but have abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
them; whatſoever the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen may
ſay in the eighth Paragraph of their Reply; in which
they endeavour to make an expreſs Negative paſs for
a Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>That which followes in the ſame Paragraph, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a Letter from Mounſieur <hi>Van Dam,</hi> deſerves
a particular reflection; not only in conſideration of
the matter of this Letter, but alſo for the perſon of
Mounſieur <hi>Van Dam,</hi> who is a Man thoroughly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
prudent, and has applyed himſelf to the affairs
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, being careful and indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in that labour, having ſerved the Company as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
for above thirty years, with the approbation
of his Maſters, and the applauſe of all thoſe who
know his deſert. After which the underwritten do
not at all doubt, but that your Excellencies will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
pardon the little Credit to what is ſaid of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Van Dam</hi> in the ſaid Reply: Not that they can
believe, that the ſtory of it could be invented by the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Deputies, who refer themſelves to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of one of your Excellencies; but believe that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61112:59"/>
time may have obliterated the traces of remembrance
of it; it not being at all credible, that a man ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect
as Monſieur <hi>Van Dam,</hi> ſhould think fit to
reprove in a Letter the behaviour of Governour <hi>Spill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
in relation to the Affairs of <hi>Bantam,</hi> without
having cleared to the bottom, the proceedings of the ſaid
Government, which is incompatible with that which
the ſaid Monſieur <hi>Van Dam</hi> has ſince judged, and
ſtill judges concerning the Affairs of <hi>Bantam;</hi> being
ſo fully perſwaded of the right of the Dutch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
pretenſions, and the wrong of that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in theſe Affairs; that all the Letters which the
under-written have received from them concerning
the matter of <hi>Bantam</hi> during their ſtay in <hi>England,</hi>
are markes full of this perſwaſion: So that it cannot be
doubted, without doing great injuſtice to Monſieur
<hi>Van Dam,</hi> but that the ſaid Letter was only conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
that is to ſay, that he condemned the behaviour
of <hi>Spillman</hi> only in caſe that the news which his friend
might have ſent him were true.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh Deputies have alſo very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the ſence of the under-written, who as they in
the ſame Eighth Paragraph, had beſtowed on them the
gift of prophecy: For it is evident, that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
deducing in their anſwer the Argument of
<hi>Cui Bono,</hi> (as the Engliſh Deputies calls it) to prove
that it was morally impoſſible for thoſe at <hi>Batavia,</hi> to
make a difference between the Old and Young King
of <hi>Bantam,</hi> with the proſpect of taking advantage of
the ſucceſs of this War; unleſs that by the gift of
Prophecy they could be able to penetrate into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of futurity; which is remote from the ſenſe
which the Engliſh Deputies wreſt from theſe words.</p>
            <p>As the under-written confeſſed frankly, that they
do not very well underſtand the true ſenſe of the laſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61112:59"/>
words of the ſame paragraph, by reaſon of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
parentheſis, are a little puzled; they will make
no anſwer to it: But yet if the Engliſh Deputies do
there offer to prove by irrefragable Arguments, that
the Dutch have driven the Engliſh from <hi>Bantam,</hi> the
under written will be very glad to be preſent at this
proof; not only that they may be able to deſtroy
it, but alſo to learn by what new ſort of Logick they
can prove by irrefragable arguments, Facts which are
proved by no depoſition of any Witneſs; without
which notwithſtanding, Facts cannot be proved which
depend on the teſtimony of the ſenſes.</p>
            <p>The Ninth Article of the ſaid Reply ſhews alſo, the
little heed which the Engliſh Deputies have given to
the Anſwer of the under-written, as to the accuſation
which they talk of (<hi>viz.</hi> the Dutch Deputies) that the
Engliſh ſhould plunder their houſe at <hi>Bantam;</hi> 'tis
equally ridiculous, falſe and impoſſible, in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
wherein things were then, for the Engliſh to
do; for ſo ſoon as the Dutch Landed, there was a
Report ſpread abroad, that all the Engliſh were to be
Maſſacred that night; it is onely to read the anſwer
of the under-written to be ſatisfyed, that it has not
pleaſed the Engliſh Deputies to give themſelves
the trouble of reading with the leaſt application
the Dutch Companies Apology, wherein upon the
matter of the plundering of the Dutch Factory, theſe
following words will be found; <q>It ought not to be
wondred at that the King having re-taken the Town
of <hi>Bantam</hi> from his Enemies, wherewith he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed,
ſhould cauſe the motions of the Engliſh to
be watched, as well as the entry and going out of the
Ships, in the apprehenſion wherein he was, ſome ill
deſign might be carried on againſt his perſon &amp; eſtate:
And that in the confuſion wherein the Affairs were
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61112:60"/>
then, the goods of other Men were taken away, which
the Directors of the Engliſh Company themſelves
could no more have prevented, than they could have
hindred in the time when the Old King made himſelf
Maſter of the Town of <hi>Bantam;</hi> and that the Dutch
Reſident <hi>Caeff</hi> was forced to take flight to ſhelter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from the violence of the <hi>Bantamers;</hi> ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi>
probably without the knowledge of their Maſters from
plundering the Dutch Factory.</q> There is no cauſe to
doubt at preſent that after the reading of theſe words,
but that the Engliſh Deputies will themſelves perceive
their Error, and the little care which they have taken
to underſtand the ſenſe of the under-written; ſince it
appears evidently in the ſaid paſſage, the time is not
ſpoken of, in which the Dutch Landed at <hi>Bantam</hi> (as
the Engliſh Deputies have underſtood it) but the time
when the old King made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Bantam;</hi> and
that the Dutch Reſident <hi>Caeſſ</hi> was forced to take flight.
There is certainly nothing more troubleſome or tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
than to ſee ones ſelf forced to clear paſſages ſo
very evident. But as this (without doubt) ought to
be attributed to the great Affairs the Engliſh Deputies
have on their hands; The under-written eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
themſelves, that in this negligence there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſign nor myſtery.</p>
            <p>The Objections which the Engliſh Deputies make
to themſelves in the Tenth paragraph of their Reply,
and the Solution, which they give to it, ſhews that
they have difficulty enough to reconcile the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Dutch with the flouriſhing condition of
the Engliſh Company.</p>
            <p>As the under-written Deputies confeſs that the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of the Dutch Company is engaged to His Majeſty
of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> (as the Engliſh Deputies ſay in the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61112:60"/>
Eleventh paragraph of their Reply.) The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
deny expreſly, that That Faith ought to be
violated in acquitting themſelves of that which the
Dutch Company owed to the King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> by
vertue of the Leagues which they have made with
this Prince.</p>
            <p>The Twelfth paragraph is injurious to the Dutch
Company; which far from not keeping their Faith
makes a conſtant profeſſion of acquitting themſelves
of it every where and towards all. The under-written,
not obſerving any thing more in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Articles, which deſerves any reflection; we will
perſiſt to deſire that Your Excellencies by your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
will acquit the Dutch Company from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of that of <hi>England,</hi> and that you will adjudge
to the Dutch Company what they demand in Re-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>

            <p>WE are ſorry and aſhamed, that we are neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to waſte Your Lordſhips time; but if
the Dutch Deputies will perſiſt injuriouſly to charge
us with calumniating them, becauſe we are forced
very gently and argumentatively only to touch ſome
of their too well known methods of managing their
Affairs in <hi>India;</hi> If likewiſe the ſaid Gentlemen, after
ſo full an anſwer as we gave (though brief and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent)
to their voluminous papers, do yet tell Your
Lordſhips we have ſaid nothing to ſeveral weighty
points (as they do in a late paper preſented Your
Lordſhips) We hope we ſhall obtain your Lordſhips
pardon for this Rejoynder, which ſhall be as ſhort as
the nature of their paper and of their practices in <hi>India</hi>
will admit.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As to the Reſtitution of <hi>Bantam,</hi> we ſay, All
the late King of glorious Memory demanded, was the
withdrawing of the Dutch Forces from <hi>Bantam,</hi> and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61112:61"/>
ſatisfaction for our dammages; and we ask no more
now, But that the Fort built with the Engliſh Money
may be left undemoliſhed, that we may be able to
defend our Factors and Servants, and preſerve the
Trade we deſign there; which as the preſent Affairs of
<hi>Bantam</hi> are, can be no otherwiſe ſecured to us. And
it is certain that the Lords States General conſented to
the withdrawing their Forces as aforeſaid, by their
anſwer to Sir <hi>John Chardins</hi> Memorial. Whether we
ſpeak truly in this or not, we are in Your Lordſhips
Judgment, upon view of the authentick Copies of the
ſaid Memorial and Reply, lodged with Sir <hi>John
Chardin,</hi> and with your Lordſhips Secretary. And
for the Gentlemen to ſay, the Lords States Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
then to Sir <hi>John Chardin,</hi> are not to be urged
now, becauſe they have ſince made Articles with that
poor Young King (which the <hi>Batavians</hi> have ſo much
abuſed and enſlaved) and who is ſo ignorant and ſo
miſerable, that he would ſet his Chop or Mark to a
Hundred blanks if they would have him: And we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
not only to your Lordſhips Wiſdom, but to all
Men of common ſenſe, whether any thing ſince done
with ſuch a poor Creature, now and then in durance, can
make any new Caſe ſince the tranſactions at the <hi>Hague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The Gentlemen ſay, they affirmed we
had only a Factory and a Reſidence in the Capital City
of <hi>Bantam,</hi> and can found no dominion upon that;
and that we have replyed nothing thereunto; wherein
(we humbly conceive) your Lordſhips will find the
Gentlemen under a great miſtake: For though our
Factory and the Fort Built with our Money were
more worth than all the reſt of the Buildings in <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam;</hi>
(which they call the Capital City) We claim no
Territory by vertue thereof; but we ſay the Old
King of <hi>Bantam</hi> was King of Right, and his Son only
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61112:62"/>
Probationary with his Fathers leave, to ſee how he
would behave himſelf, and as ſuch a King, and the Son
of a Father alwayes Obſequious to His late Majeſty of
Glorious Memory, His Embaſſadours were here recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with Reſpect: And that the Old King his Father,
(before the Articles the <hi>Dutch</hi> Gentlemen pretend to
have made with his Son,) gave that City and Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to His ſaid late Majeſty. And if the <hi>Dutch</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
will yet contend, That the Young King was
King not only Probationary, but <hi>de jure;</hi> and
that the Father was ſubject to the Son; which was
not ſo of Right by the Laws of that Country, nor can
ever be proved, but the contrary moſt certainly; if it
were worth the conteſting: Then we ſay that Young
King hath violated his publick Faith by his Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our Agent, and other publick Perſons Reſident as
Chiefs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation by Commiſſion from His
late Majeſty of Glorious Memory. And if it be true,
(as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Deputies themſelves have conſtantly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed)
That it was not the <hi>Batavians,</hi> but that
Young King of <hi>Bantam</hi> that rifled our Houſes, tore
our King's Colours, drove us from our Ancient, Great,
and Coſtly Habitations and Trade; while at the ſame
time his own Embaſſadors were treated here by His
Majeſty, and His Majeſties <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company with
the greateſt Kindneſs and Reſpect: If this be the Caſe,
do not the <hi>Dutch</hi> Deputies themſelves in Effect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
That that Young King deſerves no longer to be
correſponded with by them: And that it is moſt reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
for us that are and deſire to be their Friends, to
requeſt them to depart thence, and leave us the Fort
which our Money paid for; which is all we ask of
them with reſpect to the pretended Reſtitution of that
place; and we may ſay, to the Reſtitution of the
Majeſty and Honour of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Name and Nation,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61112:62"/>
which hath been intolerably affronted and abuſed at that
place of <hi>Bantam</hi> in ſight of many <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations.</p>
            <p>3. As to that weak Queſtion <hi>cui bono,</hi> we cannot
but wonder the Gentlemen ſhould expoſe themſelves
again to the cenſure not only of your Lordſhips, but
of all Mankind that have the leaſt knowledge of <hi>India:</hi>
They argue thus, They had favour at <hi>Bantam,</hi> a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
there, their Friend King; why ſhould they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
a War if compaſſion to their Ally had not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them, when they could not better their Condition?
Our Anſwer was full to this before; but in regard the
Gentlemen will have more of it, Your Lordſhips we
hope will pardon our telling them, that their Factory
at <hi>Bantam</hi> was uſed moſtly for buying Rice, Hens and
Proviſions; and it may be to inſpect the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
for where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are, Trade runs ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
at ſo low profit, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> care not for
medling with it in ſuch places; But if by the Artifices
they have uſed, they can keep the <hi>Engliſh, French,
Danes, Portugueez, Moores, Gentues,</hi> and <hi>Mallayes,</hi>
and all other Nations from bringing Callicoes to <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam</hi>
(which Callicoes are the principal Clothing of the
<hi>Javans</hi> and many Nations thereabout to the Eaſtward)
they may then ſell one piece of Callico for the price
that two would ſell for, when the Trade of <hi>Bantam</hi>
was open; and buy two Baharrs of <hi>Pepper</hi> for the
price they paid for one formerly; which may alter
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Companies Affairs for the better Two, or
Three Hundred Thouſand Pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> beſides
the much greater Advantage they would make by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the whole Trade of <hi>Pepper</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> if they
can keep <hi>Bantam</hi> as now it is, by any means right or
wrong. Beſides the deſign which it is manifeſt they
have in proſpect of obſtructing all other <hi>Europeans</hi>
from the <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan</hi> Trade, having (by preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61112:63"/>
all Nations from the Trade of <hi>Bantam</hi>) ſecured
as they think the two great Paſſages, <hi>viz.</hi> the Streights
of <hi>Sunda,</hi> and the Streights of <hi>Malacca.</hi> If this be
not a full Anſwer to their <hi>cui bono,</hi> let the World
judge (as we doubt not but your Lordſhips will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly,)
although the Gentlemen (with as little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
as they did before,) ſhould call the moſt clear
Truth and undenyable Arguments, by the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant
Term <hi>Gallimatias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Queſtion they diſcourſe of, <hi>viz.</hi> How it
can be imagined that the Young King ſhould be ſo
ſimple <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> We dare not ſay any more to it now, leſt
your Lordſhips ſhould apprehend it to be an abuſe of
your Lordſhips Patience, after we have ſo fully and
clearly anſwered that before.</p>
            <p>We muſt own our ſelves obliged to the Gentlemen
for the good Advice they give us in their former Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
to ſubdue our paſſions (which are too apt to ſtir
in the Minds of injured Men) and for their Prayers in
this, that God would incline us into the paths of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
and Mildneſs; and in requital thereof we ſhall
not only pray to God to forgive them for the Ocean
of Innocent Blood they have ſhed in <hi>India;</hi> but that at
length they may repent and forſake thoſe ill Methods,
by which their People at <hi>Batavia</hi> have deſigned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs
the whole Trade of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> which (in
truth) is much to be feared, if timely Remedy be not
applyed. And as to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proceedings in <hi>India,</hi>
though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company was ſettled there before
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and our Trade is not yet much inferiour
to theirs, bating only the <hi>Spice</hi> and <hi>Japan</hi> Trades
which they have engroſſed by ſuch wayes as we have
juſtly accuſed them of: We dare appeal to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
themſelves, and to all People that know any
thing of <hi>India,</hi> whether the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61112:63"/>
progreſs of their too well known Methods, have not
killed Thouſands of <hi>Indians</hi> for one that ever dyed by
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hands, upon any Cauſe or Quarrel what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever:
From whence we may reaſonably infer that
through God's Mercy we have hitherto been Men of
Meekneſs and great (if not too great) Moderation,
conſidering the manifold provocations we have had.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Van Dam</hi> we have good thoughts of, and the
better becauſe he did ſo frankly condemn thoſe ill Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of <hi>Spellman</hi>'s; and we do not remember, nor
believe there was any Conditional Words expreſſed or
implyed in his Letter fore-quoted.</p>
            <p>We obſerve the diſtinction of time which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
now make; in which they have been told the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Slaves robbed their <hi>Dutch</hi> Houſe at <hi>Bantam;</hi>
but we believe not one word thereof, neither is there
any probability of it.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more that we can obſerve in the
Gentlemen's laſt Paper, that deſerves the troubling of
your Lordſhips with one Line in Anſwer thereunto;
but one ſhort Paragraph which is indeed very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
and therefore we ſhall beg your Lordſhips leave
to repeat it <hi>verbatim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſay, <q>As to the Complaints which the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Deputies have made throughout their whole
Reply in Relation to the <hi>Dutch</hi> excluſive Contracts
with <hi>Indian</hi> Princes, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well able to juſtifie in time and place, that which
it hath alwayes maintain'd, and which it does ſtill
maintain, concerning the Right of the ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts:
In anſwer whereunto, we ſay,</q>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, This is plain dealing, throwing the Gantlet
to all Nations, and amounts to a Confeſſion of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
they have of engroſſing the whole Trade of <hi>India,</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:61112:64"/>
and that they will and may eaſily do it, is as plain,
except ſome ſpeedy Courſe be taken to defend that
Remainder of Ports and Places that are left us in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
to trade unto: For it is certainly known, that any
<hi>European</hi> Nation that is conſiderable in Naval Power
in <hi>India,</hi> may by their Shipping take ſome Advantage
upon the greateſt Native Prince of <hi>India;</hi> and it is
as certain that any Prince being ſurpriz'd, or his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Eſtates to a very conſiderable value, will for a
preſent Redemption of his Subjects from the Ruine
of ſuch a ſurprizal, grant to the Surprizer any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Trade excluſive to any other Nation or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
reſiding unarmed in his Country, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
ſuch unarmed People expelled from the Trade
of any ſuch Native Prince his Dominions, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
for ever deprived thereof, or by force of Arms
compel the Reſtitution, which can never be without
uſing force: For after ſuch Contract, they will make
themſelves Parties (as now they do with the Young
King of <hi>Bantam</hi>) and tell us in plain terms (as they
do your Lordſhips) that they muſt defend their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes,
and maintain their Contracts or Articles.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We ſay, This Aſſertion makes it evident
what the Deſign of their Fleet now or late in the Gulph
of <hi>Perſia</hi> was; where if they had proſpered in their
ſhutting up all that Great Emperours Ports, which (in
probability) they had done, if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships there
had not undertook the Navigation between <hi>India</hi> and
<hi>Perſia;</hi> and if they had not been (as by chance they
were) too many and too ſtrong to be obſtructed by
the <hi>Dutch</hi> at that time, Your Lordſhips may eaſily
conceive what Articles that Great Emperour of
<hi>Perſia</hi> muſt have entred into to perſwade the <hi>Dutch</hi>
to open his Ports again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:61112:64"/>
Thirdly, Hereby your Lordſhips may ſee by what
Title the <hi>Dutch</hi> hold the whole Trade of the <hi>Spice</hi>
Iſlands, although there be very many of them that
have not one <hi>Dutchman</hi> reſident upon them: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which, we have forborne many Years viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thoſe Iſlands, becauſe we would ſhun all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that might make any miſunderſtanding between
the two Nations.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We muſt deny (under favour of theſe
Gentlemen) that the <hi>Dutch</hi> have alwayes or at any
time maintained, or could maintain, their pretended
Right of ſuch excluſive Contracts; which will be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
to your Lordſhips not only by the laſt Articles
of Peace and Commerce made with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but
by the large Arguments on both ſides, which remain
upon Record, and were managed more cloſely and to
the purpoſe, (as to this point) than any thing we have
ſeen from theſe Gentlemen: On the part of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
by Mounſieur <hi>Van Benninghen</hi> and others, and on the
part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by Mr. Secretary <hi>Trevor,</hi> Sir <hi>Will.
Temple,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Downing.</hi> The Reſult of all
which long and cloſe Argumentation was (as your
Lordſhips may obſerve it) ſettled in the Treaty, That
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might trade to all places, and even to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
blockard or beſieged with any Commodities except
contraband Goods.</p>

                  <p>THE Deputies of the Company of <hi>Holland</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
read and conſidered the Triplique or
Third Paper of the Deputies of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
They have obſerved to their great Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that thoſe Gentlemen far from acknowledging the
Reproaches and Invectives which run through their
whole Reply, or ſecond Anſwer, do ſeem to pretend,
That it ought to be owned as an Obligation that
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company which is thereby handled and
rent in the moſt outragious manner in the World, is
treated therein with Mildneſs and Moderation, and that
the ſaid Company comes off at ſo eaſie a Rate.</p>
                  <p>The ſubſcribed inſtead of rendering injury for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
and making uſe of the Law of Retaliation; do
earneſtly deſire the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen to conſider,
That although their Company (by enjoying the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of a Crowned Head, and of a Monarch for
whom the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company doth proteſt they have the
utmoſt Veneration) be elevated above a Company
who can boaſt of a Protection only of a Republick;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61112:65"/>
yet their ſaid Company cannot make ſuch ill uſe of
their quality, as to oppreſs and trample on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Holland</hi> in that manner, as will be ſo far
from pleaſing his Majeſty, that it will doubtleſs bring
upon them his Royal Indignation.</p>
                  <p>As to the Anſwer of the Lords the States General,
to the Memorial of Sir <hi>John Chardin,</hi> ſince that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of producing the ſame, it hath pleaſed the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Deputies to refer themſelves only thereunto; The
ſubſcribed will alſo refer to the ſame, being aſſured
that your Honours will not find there what is alledged
by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Deputies; but on the contrary, will
ſee what the Subſcribed have ſaid thereof in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
So that there needs only the pains of reading
of it to, be undeceived.</p>
                  <p>As to what the Subſcribed ſaid in their Anſwer,
That it was a very ſtrange thing that the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Company, who had only their Reſidence and Factory
at <hi>Bantam,</hi> ſhould now pretend to the City and Fort
of <hi>Bantam;</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> do by their third Paper ſay,
That the Factory and Fort built with their Money
were worth all the reſt of the Buildings on that place;
As if the price and value of their Factory, and the
Money which they may have lent the King (which is
not believed no more than the value of their Factory,
which was only an old building) could give them any
right of Propriety and Lordſhip over the City and
Fort of <hi>Bantam,</hi> which is contrary to all Laws Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and Civil; which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen being
alſo well aware of, They add that they do not ground
their pretenſions thereupon; but do ſay, that the Old
King of <hi>Bantam</hi> was a Lawful King, and his Son only
Conditional, and at the will of his Father.</p>
                  <p>This is a new method of acting, and a ſtrange way
of proceeding, after the Subſcribed have given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61112:66"/>
the pains to prove in their Anſwer, by ſolemn
and authentick proofs, that the Old Sultan of <hi>Bantam</hi>
did aſſign over his Kingdom to his eldeſt Son, without
reſerving to himſelf any thing, even not ſo much as
<hi>Tartiaſſa,</hi> the place of his retreat: And that his Son
having by vertue of this Aſſignment, aſcended the
Throne, did ſend his Embaſſadors every where; and
that he was acknowledged as a Lawful King, not only
by the Deceaſed King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> of Glorious
Memory, but alſo by thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company.
Now they come and ſay, that the Young King was
only a Conditional King, and at the will of His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
without refuting the proofs of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and without proving ſuch condition and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
as is now alledged.</p>
                  <p>The inveighing againſt the Young King of <hi>Bantam,</hi>
is a mark of animoſity; as to which the Subſcribed
having already declared their ſentiment in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
they will forbear to make any further mention
thereof at preſent.</p>
                  <p>As to the queſtion of <hi>cui bono,</hi> the Subſcribed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
endeavoured in vain to cauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to apprehend the force of their Argument; They
do not ſee <hi>cui bono;</hi> and to what ends they ſhould
break their heads any further about it, ſince it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by their triplique or third Paper, that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
no more of it than if the Subſcribed had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Riddles to them.</p>
                  <p>As to what follows about the pretended Cruelties
of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> their ſanguinary humour, and of
the mild temper of the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> It is a ſign of animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
and ſelf-love, which ſeldom hearkens to Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>As to what is ſo much inſiſted on, that the Subſcribed
ſhould propoſe as to the excluſive Contracts, that the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Company could ſufficiently prove, in time and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61112:66"/>
place, what they have ſo often alledged, and do ſtill
alledge as to the right of the ſaid Contracts; this is
without any reaſon or ground; and certainly if it
were their buſineſs to prove that Right now, the
Subſcribed would make it appear that there is nothing
better grounded; the ſame being all duly explained
and limited.</p>
                  <p>The Subſcribed will finiſh this their fourth Paper,
adding only, that Mounſieur <hi>Van Dam</hi> is in no wiſe
ſatisfied with the proceedings of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as to his particular; and that he could have
wiſhed, (as he mentions in his laſt Letters) that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of putting his name in the triplique or third Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
in ſo odious a manner, they would have produced
the Letter therein mentioned; by which it would
have appeared, that all that Mr. <hi>Van Dam</hi> wrote
about the conduct of the Governour <hi>Spellman</hi> in the
affairs of <hi>Bantam,</hi> was grounded only upon a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of things which he had heard; and time having
diſcovered them to be falſe, it would not be at all
generous to alledge or inſiſt on ſuch a Letter at

                  <p>THe Court of Committees for the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Company have this day ſeriouſly conſidered the
two Propoſitions made to us by your Lordſhips, the
fourth inſtant, at my Lord Treaſurers Lodgings.
And as to the firſt, it is our humble opinion, that the
<hi>Dutch</hi> have no ſincere meaning that we ſhould live in
ſecurity at <hi>Bantam,</hi> in Neighbourly Peace and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with them, unleſs they do conſent to deliver the
Fort undemoliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe ſince they do agree to withdraw all
their Forces from that place, and that we ſhall build
a Fort there without interruption from them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If
they mean ſincerely, it is better for them to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the trouble and charges of pulling that down;
and to us the charge of building a new one, and the
rather, becauſe we are willing to accept of the ſaid
Fort as part of our dammages.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Since it is propoſed, that they ſhould
leave all things at <hi>Bantam</hi> in the ſame condition they
were before the War between the Father and the Son;
and this Fort was built with our Money, and in being
before the War; why ſhould not they leave the Fort
ſtanding, and all the Companies buildings, as well as
withdraw all their Forces from the place?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:61112:68"/>
Thirdly, Becauſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> did never comply with
any agreement they made with us; we do ſincerely
believe by all their carriage in this Treaty, and by
the Hoſtilities uſed on the Coaſt of <hi>Malabar,</hi> ſince the
ſurprize of <hi>Bantam;</hi> that they never intend we ſhould
reſide at <hi>Bantam,</hi> ſecured by a Fortification and an
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Garriſon; no more than they do intend to
give us <hi>Batavia.</hi> And therefore what ever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
we conclude they will ſo under hand furniſh our
Enemy the Young King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> with Money and
black Soldiers of all Nations, that our People at <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam</hi>
ſhall be murthered whileſt they are at work, and
never be permitted to erect any conſiderable Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
Or elſe they will pretend they have bought
the Cuſtomes of the King of <hi>Bantam;</hi> and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
other ſhifts, whereby they will diſappoint the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
ſettlement of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in that place; or elſe
they will forbid any of the Natives to work upon our
Fortifications; well knowing that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiers
will not labour at ſuch work in thoſe hot Countries:
Or one way or other they will certainly (as they have
ever done, notwithſtanding all agreements to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary)
prevent our ſettlement until our Men are dead,
or diſabled by the Diſeaſes of that Country; of
which practice of theirs we have had great experience
formerly.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Such an attempt of building a Fort fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
will not onely make us about One Hundred
Thouſand Pounds worſe then now we are, but many
brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mens lives will be thrown away to no
effect; Our Gracious Sovereign will be infinitely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured;
and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name and Nation become
a reproach, and contemptible in the Eyes of thoſe
Eaſtern Nations; and the <hi>Dutch</hi> wiſdom, power and
policy will be extolled to ſuch a degree, as that an
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61112:68"/>
                     <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man will be aſhamed to ſhew his face in thoſe
parts of the World: Whereas on the contrary, if it
be ſtill inſiſted upon to have Fort delivered to us
undemoliſhed; it will be granted or denyed: If it be
denyed, we are in a much better condition than ever
we can be by the Propoſition aforeſaid; for by ſuch
denyal no vaſt ſumme of Money can be loſt; no Mens
lives will be caſt away; no ſhame and reproach can
befal our Nation; and our demand will be juſt and
good againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> hereafter: And in the mean
time, we ſhall go on to ſtrengthen <hi>Priaman,</hi> and as
near as we can, make it impregnable againſt all the
power of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>India;</hi> which is much better
then to throw away charge and mens lives where we
are ſure they will be loſt with ſhame and diſhonour.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould agree to deliver us the
Caſtle undemoliſhed, they will perform their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or they will not: If they do perform it, we
will (with Gods aſſiſtance) ſoon make our ſelves ſo
ſtrong as not to fear what they can do againſt us: If
they do not perform it, it would be a plain violation
of their Contract with His Majeſty; the proof where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
will be plain and eaſie, and the guilt thereof they
can no way evade: But according to the propoſition
we are diſcourſing of, they will eaſily contrive means
totally to prevent our ſettlement, and yet pretend to
juſtifie themſelves, that they did what they promiſed,
and throw the blame upon us by a multitude of falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
untruths, and falſe Witneſſes, which they never
want.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, We humbly conceive we have clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
to your Lordſhips in our larger Papers, in
Anſwer to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Deputies, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
deſign nothing leſs than the engroſsment of the
whole Trade of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> and that their ways
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61112:69"/>
have been always, by force or fraud, to ſurprize one
place, and then be quiet for ten or twelve years, till
the noiſe of that injury is over in <hi>Europe,</hi> and then to
deprive us of ſome other place. So that while we
are demanding our Right at <hi>Bantam,</hi> and the noiſe of
that injury is unallayed, it hath formerly been ſome
kind of ſecurity againſt other attempts for a ſeaſon,
(and may prove ſo at this time) although in the latter
part of His late Majeſties Reign they have been more
preſumptuous than they were formerly, by forcing
us from <hi>Macaſſar;</hi> and before they had allayed or
paid for that, they did the ſame thing again at <hi>Bantam,</hi>
and attempted the like at <hi>Malabarr;</hi> of which we
believe our next Ships may bring us ſome further
account.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Whoever concludes the <hi>Dutch</hi> will
now obſtinately refuſe to deliver us the Caſtle, muſt
at the ſame time believe, they will with the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy,
and with more eaſe to themſelves, prevent
us from building one at <hi>Bantam.</hi> And therefore we
are humbly of opinion, it is much better nothing be
done at this time, than that which is propounded,
which is worſe than nothing; becauſe beſides the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
dammages and diſparagements that would accrue
thereby in <hi>India;</hi> Such an error in a Treaty may be
of ill conſequence; for that undoubtedly the <hi>Dutch</hi>
(when ſuch a Treaty is concluded) would be as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to make the World ſenſible of their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in it, as they are now to ſuppreſs the Sight of it.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, As to your Lordſhips ſecond propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we humbly conceive, that as it is worded, it
would make our Condition much worſe than now it
is, by the Treaty of Peace and Commerce in force
between the two Nations: By the plain words where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
(we humbly conceive) the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have a right
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61112:69"/>
indubitably of Trading to every part and place in
<hi>India;</hi> which we hope they ſhall ever have without
leave of the Dutch: And we think that matter is ſo
well ſettled by the ſaid Treaty in force, that any thing
to be added thereunto, would make our caſe worſe
and not better, and therefore we have never complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of any defect in the ſaid Treaty; but of the Dutch
for violating thereof at <hi>Macaſſar</hi> and at <hi>Bantam,</hi> in
one and the ſame manner whatever difference or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
they pretend to make in either Caſe.</p>
                  <p>All which we humbly ſubmit to your Lordſhips.</p>
                  <closer>

                  <p>IN Obedience to your Lordſhips Commands on
Wedneſday laſt, We have ſeriouſly re-conſidered
our laſt Paper preſented to your Lordſhips; and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
craving your Lordſhips pardon for any Error or
Offence in the words thereof; we think we ſhould fail
of our Duty to His Majeſty and your Lordſhips, if
we ſhould not adhere to the ſubſtance of that Paper;
it being our unfeigned and unanimous opinion that it is
more for the Honour and Intereſt of His Majeſty and
of His Kingdoms in general, That the Treaty of 1674-75.
ſhould remain as it is, than that any new agreement
ſhould be made concerning <hi>Bantam;</hi> except the Fort
there be delivered undermoliſhed in part of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
great dammages.</p>
                  <p>And although in our former Papers preſented to
your Lordſhips for the Dutch Deputies view; We
have given reaſons to juſtifie our demands of the Fort
undemoliſhed, which we did not at firſt ask by Sir
<hi>John Chardin</hi> (which reaſons we humbly conceive the
Dutch <hi>Eaſt-India-Company,</hi> have not nor can ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
anſwer:) But now, ſince this Paper is to be
ſeen only by your Lordſhips, and not by the Dutch
Commiſſioners; We hope we ſhall clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61112:70"/>
to your Lordſhips that what we firſt demanded
from the Dutch by Sir <hi>John Chardin,</hi> was (though
not the ſame in words yet) in Reality, Effect, and
Conſequence as much or more than we now demand
of them: For at that time we had a ſtrong Fleet of
Three and Twenty Ships, with Souldiers in board
ready to Sail for <hi>Bantam;</hi> the Old King of <hi>Bantam</hi>
our Friend, was then at or near <hi>Bantam,</hi> in the head
of a great Army; and he had given that City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
to His late Majeſty. Under which Circumſtances
at that time, if the Dutch had delivered effectual Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to withdraw their Forces from <hi>Bantam,</hi> we
ſhould with that Fleet and that Alliance, have been
in the poſſeſſion of the Fort of <hi>Bantam</hi> immediately on
our firſt arrival there; and in a better poſture than
we can now be with the Fort reſtored to us undemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed;
becauſe now the Old King is a Priſoner in the
hands of the Dutch, and his Army all overcome and
diſperſed.</p>

            <p>The foregoing Original papers exhibited to the
Lords Commiſſioners Deciſors, by the Commiſſioners
Inſtructors for both Companies; we think may give
ſufficient ſatisfaction to any indifferent perſons, not
onely of the ſtate of the Controverſie, but a full juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Engliſh <hi>Eaſt-India-Companies</hi> Right to
have <hi>Bantam</hi> ſo reſtored, that they may hope to live
there without having their Throats cut, or being
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61112:71"/>
Stabbed, as the Engliſh Agent formerly was, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being obnoxious to the having all taken from them
in a moment at the pleaſure of the <hi>Batavians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now becauſe all <hi>Sumatra</hi> abounds with <hi>Pepper,</hi> they
pretend a Right to the whole Territory of that Iſland,
which is computed bigger than <hi>England,</hi> full of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants;
whereon as they confeſs are many diſtinct
Kingdoms, which are governed by antient Soveraign
Hereditary Princes: And we dare preſume to ſay,
They have not Two Hundred Dutch men upon the
whole Iſland; and we believe not Ten Dutch Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
having no place that we know upon that whole
Iſland able to reſiſt Twenty <hi>Europeans,</hi> but <hi>Padang</hi>
and <hi>Pollocinco;</hi> and their Forts upon them are very
inconſiderable; neither of them having a Garriſon of
above Fifty or Sixty <hi>Europeans,</hi> and about the like
number of black Fellows which are of no value.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Bencoolen</hi> they do not now, nor ever did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend;
but ſay it belongs or owes ſubjection to the
Young King of <hi>Bantam:</hi> Which if it be true, we have
rightfully taken poſſeſſion of it, That King being our
declared Enemy; but we ſhall ſay more of that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Atcheen, Pryaman, Teco</hi> and <hi>Indrapoora,</hi> they did
formerly pretend; and they may (as the Reader will
ſee hereafter) with as much reaſon pretend to all <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia;</hi>
and ſo (queſtionleſs) they will in a little time,
if the Kings of <hi>Europe</hi> and their reſpective priviledged
Companies will give them leave, firſt to take the
principal places, and then be content to accept of a
little Money for them, not the Hundredth part of the
true value of them. But they muſt firſt diſpatch this
buſineſs of <hi>Pepper,</hi> and make that Commodity entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their own (as they have all other Spices already)
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61112:71"/>
and then they need neither pay nor thank any King (or
their priviledged Companies) of <hi>Europe</hi> for letting
them take all the reſt, becauſe the profit of that ſingle
Commodity, if it were in one hand, would defray the
charge of a power ſufficient to defend all the Coaſts of
<hi>India</hi> from any new-comers; and to enſlave the Sea
Coaſts of all thoſe great Monarchs of the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> who
though they have great Forces by Land, have no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
power, and very little skill in taking of Fortreſſes,
being not accuſtomed to the uſe of Fire-Arms.</p>
            <p>☜We know the World better, than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a Confeſſion of guilt from States-Men; and we
know how to diſtinguiſh between the Dutch Nation,
and the Dutch <hi>Eaſt-India-Company;</hi> the former may
be as in-offenſive and Juſt, as any other Nation; but
the latter (doubtleſs) have always been a moſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
people; for which difference the famous <hi>John
De Wit</hi> aſſayes to give a reaſon in a certain Treatiſe
he hath ſet forth.</p>
            <p>But our end being not to cavil or contend for maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in words, much leſs to promote War or diſſenſion
(with which they unjuſtly charge the Engliſh <hi>Eaſt-India-Company.</hi>)
We ſhall ſatisfie our ſelves, if we
can obtain a Witneſs or Juſtification in the hearts and
minds of the good and peaceable men of both Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for which purpoſe, if any of the States or other
of the Dutch Nation diſ-intereſted in theſe debates,
doubt the truth of the Engliſh Companies Allegations,
we will ask no more, but that to ſatisfie themſelves
throughly, they would privately diſcourſe ſome of the
Dutch themſelves that were at <hi>Bantam</hi> or <hi>Batavia,
Anno</hi> 1682. when <hi>Bantam</hi> was ſurprized, or at any
time ſince.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:61112:72"/>
Secondly, We would pray them likewiſe to read
their own Hiſtories, and obſerve therein whether moſt
of the wrongs complained of by the Engliſh in all ages,
were not perpetrated by the Dutch Company in time
of full Peace, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The falling upon the Engliſh and beating them out
of the Trade of <hi>Japan:</hi> The taking from them <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore,
Polloway,</hi> and <hi>Pollaroone,</hi> Nutmeg Iſlands; and
depriving them of the Trade of <hi>Banda, Seram,</hi> and
others of the <hi>Banda</hi> Iſlands; as alſo of the Trades of
the <hi>Moluccas</hi> or Clove Iſlands; (not to revive the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of that unparallel'd inhumanity at <hi>Amboyna,</hi>)
and in latter times by their depriving them of the <hi>Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
Trades of <hi>Japarra, Andragera, Lampoon, Pollin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam,</hi>
and <hi>Jambee</hi> in the South-Seas, and <hi>Porcat</hi> upon
the Coaſt of <hi>Mallabar;</hi> beſides thoſe Things and
Places lately complained of by His Majeſties Envoy
at the <hi>Hague.</hi> And if any Engliſh Gentleman would
be further ſatisfied as to thoſe paſt injuries, we need
only referr them to Mr. <hi>Purchas</hi>'s <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> the firſt
part toward the latter end of that Book.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Ask any plain hearted <hi>Bewinthebber,</hi> or
any honeſt Dutch Skipper that knows <hi>India,</hi> whether
the Dutch have not been contriving theſe Twenty
years to turn the Engliſh out of the Trade of <hi>Pepper;</hi>
and whether their General <hi>Matſuker</hi> at <hi>Batavia</hi> had
not a Warrant dormant (and ſince him their late
General <hi>Van Goens</hi>) to enterprize that buſineſs of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam</hi>
when ever they could effect it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Ask any ſober minded man, whether the
encroaching, reſtleſs, covetous, humour of the Dutch
Company, hath not imbroyled the two Nations in
great Wars and Blood-ſhed within the ſpace of one
age; and whether it be Wiſdom to try that hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
experiment again, with ſuch a load of guilt upon
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61112:72"/>
them? Whether it were not more prudent, (ſince
they have the noble places of Trade in <hi>India</hi> already)
to ſit down quietly and let their Neighbours peaceably
imploy their induſtry to gain a penny by their leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</p>
            <p>Whether that encroaching Game be not played far
enough already, and it were not Wiſdom now to ſet
bounds to their Dominion in <hi>India?</hi> (as their wiſer
States-men ſeem to have ſet bounds to the encreaſe of
their Territory at home) leaſt indignation provoke the
great Kings of <hi>Europe</hi> to viſit thoſe remote Regions w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
their Royal Navies at their proper charge, and thereby
diſcover a ſecret yet unobſerved by the Kings of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
(viz.</hi>) That <hi>Sampſons</hi> ſtrength lies in his locks more
than in his Brains, or his robuſt body and bones; and
that the dutch Company is no leſs hated in <hi>India</hi> by all
Nations by reaſon of their Tyranny and Oppreſſion,
than their State in <hi>Europe</hi> is loved by their beſt Friends
and Confederates? Whether their own people in <hi>India</hi>
(which are a mixture of all fugitive <hi>Europeans</hi>) do not
think themſelves under great Slavery, by reaſon of
their Companies ſeverity? and whether their very
countenances as well as their diſcourſes, do not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their diſcontents as the very Clothes (or rather
want of Clothes) of their common Sea-men proclaims
their exceſſive penury: Whereas on the contrary the
Dutch Sea-men in <hi>Europe,</hi> may be diſtinguiſht from
other Nations by the neatneſs, wholeneſs, cleanlineſs,
and ſufficiency of their garments: And whether if they
be preſſed hard in <hi>India</hi> now they have ſtretched their
Arms ſo wide and graſp't ſo much, they will not be
found much weaker then they were Fifty years paſt
when they had not half ſo many Forts, and their own
Servants and the Natives necks were not ſo gaul'd by
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61112:73"/>
their Iron Yokes, which have ſince been ſtraitned upon
them. <hi>Verbum ſapienti ſufficit!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To wave long and tedious diſcourſes, the ſhort
caſe is, whether a Contract for the ſole Commerce
with any Countrey, or a ſmall Fort upon a Coaſt of a
vaſt Extent, or the pretence of War with any of the
Native Princes, ſhall deprive any <hi>Europe</hi> Nation (being
in Friendſhip with the Dutch) from Trading to ſuch
Countrey in <hi>India</hi> where ſuch Contract hath been
made, or ſuch Fort built, or ſuch pretence of War
begun? we ſay, none of theſe can or ought to hinder
a Nation in friendſhip with the Dutch, from Trading
with the Natives of that Countrey or People, without
making War in <hi>India</hi> every moment of time that any
Nation hath peace with the Dutch in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before we proceed to the argument, we own that
where-ever the Dutch have the ſole Occupancy, or
the exerciſe of the ſole Dominion, of any place or
Countrey; they may without breach of Peace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
any Friend-Nation from Trading to that place;
and this conceſſion overthrowes all the arguments
they draw from the Engliſh Laws of preſerving or
confining the ſole Trade of <hi>Barbadoes, Virginia,</hi> &amp;c.
to the Kings ſubjects only.</p>
            <p>To give ſome inſtances of the Caſe or Propoſition
before aſſerted (which will open the Readers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;)
We ſhall begin at the North of <hi>India, viz.</hi>

            <p>It is famouſly known that the Emperour of <hi>Perſia</hi>
owes the Engliſh Company a vaſt ſum of money for
the Arrears of their half Cuſtom of <hi>Gombroon,</hi> due to
them for the expence of their Blood and Treaſure in
helping the <hi>Perſian</hi> to take <hi>Ormus</hi> from the <hi>Portugueez.</hi>
Now if the Engliſh ſhould at any time think fit to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61112:73"/>
War, on this indubitably juſt occaſion, upon the
King of <hi>Perſia</hi> and his Subjects, for the Recovery of
their known juſt Debt: ſuppoſe the Dutch ſhould
come at the ſame time to Trade with their Ships, (in
goods not <hi>Contraband</hi>) at <hi>Gombroon,</hi> and the Engliſh
ſhould hinder them from Trading, or from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
Lighters or Boats to Land their goods, and Ballaſt
their Ships: Would not the Dutch cry out loudly and
juſtly, This is againſt natural Right, and a breach of
the peace? And would it be any diminution of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
to ſay the Engliſh would lend them Boats?
Might not they reply, what is lent is not of Right, but
of Courteſie, and may be taken again when the lender
pleaſeth? Beſides that it would be a ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
put upon the Dutch Nation in ſight of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
to tell them, you ſhall have no Boats but what
we pleaſe. But this hath never been the Engliſh pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice:

            <p>YOU have been pleaſed to require us for ſome time
not to unload our Ship the <hi>Bengal Merchant,</hi>
now in the Road, of the Honourable Companies goods
aboard her. Should we conſent to that, How long
muſt our Ship continue here without making an end
of her buſineſs? We have peruſed and looked over
the <hi>Marine</hi> Treaty between His Majeſty of <hi>Great
Brittain</hi> and the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and we cannot find
any Article whereon you can ground, or whereby you
can juſtifie, the ſtopping or impeding the unlading

have imployed in that Service. It is not to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

you ſhall have Wars, that our Ships muſt lye ſtill till
you conclude a peace: If ſo, what enjoyment have
we by the Treaty? Boats are to be underſtood neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
without which Ships (when they come into
Harbour) cannot do their buſineſs: Therefore we
ſuppoſe not mentioned in the Articles of Peace. 'Tis
late of the year, and the Ship has but a ſmall time of

which we underſtand to our great Admiration,
the Complaints which you were pleaſed to produce for
the ſiezing of a certain <hi>Perſian</hi> Boat rowing amongſt
our Ships, which you pretend to have hired for the
unlading of your Ship the <hi>Bengall Merchant;</hi> as alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
us for detaining the Goods for ſome time which
were carried in her. In anſwer to which ye cannot be
ignorant how that this Port and <hi>Perſian</hi> Bay hath been
blockt up with Eight or Nine Ships for almoſt a whole
year: And although our Agents be attending the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:61112:77"/>
Court, to compoſe thoſe differences: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
our Men were Hoſtilely driven from the Coaſts,
our Flagg thrown down, and that (according to report)
the Inhabitants of the City of <hi>Gombrone</hi> threatned us,
that we ſhould be overwhelmed here in this Port with
the <hi>Perſian</hi> Sea Forces: which things Nature it ſelf tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
us to prevent. And foraſmuch as it ſeems good
to us to deſtroy all the <hi>Perſian</hi> Ships, yet it never came
into our thoughts you ſhould incur any Damage by it,
as you your ſelves very well know it was not done
in the unlading, or lading of the Ship <hi>Williamſon,</hi> who
came and went, although loaden with <hi>Perſian</hi> Goods.
But on the contrary, we offered Yeſterday to your
Interpreter <hi>David</hi> (when the aforeſaid <hi>Perſian</hi> Boat
was ſeized on ſailing amongſt our Fleet) our Long-boats
for your Service to unlade your Ship; and for
that very reaſon we were no hindrance at all in the
leaſt to your Affairs: And that our Ships might be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſecure from the imminent dangers of our ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Enemies, who affirmed they ſailed under your
Name, and by your Order. But you ſeem to incline
rather to accuſe us very unjuſtly, that we had ſeized
on your Goods being two Cheſts of Roſe-water; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to accept of our kindneſs in offering our
Long-boats. The aforeſaid Interpreter <hi>David</hi> took
along with him, thoſe two little Cheſts with the ſame
Boat which brought him from the Shoar, whileſt that
ſloop was carryed down to our Ship. And ſeeing the
Caſe is thus, you ſeem to darken the truth of things by
patcht-up Fictions and forged Tales. This your ſo
ill-grounded and ſtrange Accuſations, does not at all
concern us, ſeeing that even from the beginning of this
Expedition we have patiently borne all thoſe Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

all things were carryed on with ſuch apparent loſs to

On <hi>Sunday</hi> the Third of <hi>May,</hi> the ſaid Admiral ſent
me word aboard our Ship <hi>Bengall Merchant,</hi> and the
ſame in Writing he ſent aſhoar unto the Honourable
<hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi> Companyes Factors in <hi>Gombrone,</hi>
That they being now at Wars with the <hi>Perſians</hi> would
not ſuffer any of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Boats to help unlade our
Ship: To which I anſwered, That the next Morning
Boats were appointed to come off, to begin to unlade
us; and that in each of them there would be an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Man, whereby the Admiral or his People might
know that they were Boats imployed in the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Service; and I deſired they would give us no hindrance
or moleſtation in our buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Our Factors from the Shoar ſent off one to the ſaid
Admiral and his Council, whom he found reſolved to
ſtop all <hi>Perſian</hi> Boats from coming off to us.</p>
            <p>On the Fourth of <hi>May</hi> Six Boats were provided by
our Factors for the unlading our Ship, of the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi> Companyes Goods; and in
each of the Boats an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man: The Firſt Boat that
came off, the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſent their Boat from the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's
Ship, and ſeized and carryed her aboard of the
Admiral, with one of our Men, (named <hi>Thomas
Morley</hi>) in her and ſeveral Goods in her, ordered by
our Companies Factors to be put on board of our Ship.
The reſt of the Six Boats ſeeing the Firſt Boat taken,
returned aſhoar, and thoſe of them that were not put
from ſhoar, remained there; and ſo we could get
none off. This Action of the Admiral and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
was committed by them whileſt <hi>Senior David</hi> was
aboard with them (he being Linguiſt unto the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi> Companies Factors in this
place) and ſent by them with a Letter to inform the
Admiral and his Councel, That theſe Boats (whereof
he had taken one,) were imployed in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61112:79"/>
and by the Treaty Marine ought not to be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
The Goods that were Laden in the <hi>Perſian</hi>
Boat for our Ship, the <hi>Dutch</hi> took out, and put into
our Boat by force; ſhe being there waiting upon the
Linguiſt <hi>Seniour David;</hi> who ſeeing the Admiral and
his Councils Reſolution, told them, that we would
buy Boats and make them our own: Some of them
replyed, if we did they would ſtop them. Upon this
I was forced, with our own Boats and Men, to carry
a great deal of the Companies Goods aſhoar to ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
our Ship, to the great Hazard and Dammage of
the ſaid Goods, and of the Lives and Healths of our
Men, in this Extream hot Place and Seaſon.</p>
            <p>On the Ninth of <hi>May</hi> having ſomewhat lightned our
Ship, we removed her in toward the Shore, that we
might in ſome meaſure, be able from her to relieve all
ſuch Boats as came off to us, from the Inſolent Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the ſaid Admiral and his Council, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
in ſtriving to lay her conveniently near, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
we grounded ſeveral Tides towards low Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to the great hazard of our Ship and Cargoe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forced thereunto by the Inſolence of the Admiral,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> to our Boats whileſt our Ship lay farther off.</p>
            <p>The Honourable <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi> Companies Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
having been forced to buy Three Boats in
<hi>Gombroone,</hi> on the Twelfth and Thirteenth of <hi>May,</hi>
becauſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> had threatned to take them away;
we were forced to go aſhore with our Ships Boats,
and Forty or Fifty armed Men in them, and guard
theſe Three Boats off to our Ship; and every time
afterwards, when theſe Boats were to come off, we
were forced to ſend our Boat to wait upon them, or
elſe they would not come: Which ſo ſending our
Boats and Men to and agen, was more hindrance and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61112:80"/>
loſs of time to us than if we had done the Work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them.</p>
            <p>On the Seventeenth of <hi>May</hi> we having put out
what Goods we could, until we had ballaſt, for want
of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Boats to bring it to us, as accuſtomary
in this place; we were forced with our Ship and three
Boats that were bought, to ſail from hence to the
Iſland <hi>Ormuzz,</hi> and there with great trouble and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
to take in Ballaſt ſuch as we could pick up.
In doing which Seven Dayes were ſpent before we
could obtain this Road again, which need not to have
been if we had not been hindred or moleſted by the
Admiral, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as aforeſaid; for it is evident that
whileſt we were putting out our Goods, we might
have had Ballaſt brought to us dayly as we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it.</p>
            <p>Now conſidering the great loſs of time by us ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained,
through the hindrance and moleſtation given
us by you <hi>Rehnier Caſembroot</hi> Admiral, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Council as
aforeſaid, whom I find to be men of ſuch exact <hi>Dutch</hi>
Principles that you are bound by no League or Treaty
farther than it ſuits with your preſent Intereſt, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
not by the Treaty Marine: Therefore I
ſhould think my ſelf remiſs in Duty to my King and
Country, and to all my Imployers, If I ſhould let
theſe things paſs in ſilence, without declaring againſt
them and proteſting the ſame.</p>
            <p>And I do by theſe Preſents (in the behalf of my

Hindrance, Let and Moleſtation given to us in our
Trade as aforeſaid, without any manner of Occaſion
or Aggravation given by me or any under me, in any
wiſe whatſoever; but is wholly contrary to the Firſt
Article of the Treaty Marine before cited, and of the
whole Body of the ſaid Treaty.</p>
            <p>And in particular, I likewiſe farther Proteſt (in the
behalf of all Perſons concerned aforeſaid) againſt you
Captain of the Ship <hi>Blew Hulke,</hi> (and if I am not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed

Captain under the aforeſaid Admiral, for ſending Boat

off to our Ship (with <hi>Thomas Morley</hi> one of our Men
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61112:81"/>
in her) and likewiſe Goods in her to be brought
aboard our Ship <hi>Bengall Merchant</hi> as aforeſaid, and
thereby hindring other Boats coming off to our Ship
to help us unlade; and ſo hath given us much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
and moleſtation in our Trade, Time, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
with the Natives, contray to the ſaid Treaty
Marine, and the Firſt and Ninth Articles of the ſame,

            <p>YOUR <hi>Proteſt</hi> was delivered to us the Firſt
day of <hi>June,</hi> according to your Account, by
thoſe whoſe buſineſs it was: And after we had peruſed
the ſame, we found many things declared in it which
indeed were otherwiſe than you took to be, or then
was correſpondent to truth. Therefore we think it
needleſs to anſwer any thing more to them than what
was done by our Addreſſe the Thirteenth and Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>May,</hi> (according to our Account) to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
reſiding here, Mr. <hi>Daniel Edwards</hi> and Mr. <hi>Francis

Matter is fully contained: Therefore we refer our
ſelves to the ſame. Yet we declare our ſelves guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
in as much as in your drawing near to the ſhore,
your Ship ſtrook ground ſo often; for that is not to
be imputed to us, but to your imprudence. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
we never hindred or forbid the Boats to come
and bring you Ballaſt; therefore that is to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the <hi>Perſians:</hi> And the loſs of your time
(through which for that Reaſon you ſuppoſe your
ſelves hindred) is not to be aſcribed to us but to them:
And we declare that we are Men of no ſuch ill Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
as you are pleaſed to ſay us to be; but that
the ſame ought rather to be aſcribed to you, as it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
appears from your unjuſt <hi>Proteſt:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61112:82"/>
we do not eſteem it a matter of ſo great moment
(that if any Diſpute ſhould ariſe betwixt your and
our Company concerning this thing) but that we are
able (in as much as Equity and Truth is on our ſide)
to defend our ſelves. Therefore we Declare (or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt)

            <p>HErewith is incloſed a Proteſt made by me againſt
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Admiral <hi>Rehnier Caſembroot, &amp;c.</hi>
and a <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation made of it at his requeſt, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he could not underſtand it in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>) In the
Proteſt you will ſee how they hindered us from the
help of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Boats. And in regard theſe their
actions fell only upon me, and not before nor ſince;
I think it my Duty to give your Honours as brief an
Account of the reaſon thereof as I can. It ſeems
about two Months before we came hither, the <hi>Perſian
Kawn,</hi> or Governour of theſe parts, and the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Admiral, had agreed that the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſhould deliver
to the <hi>Dutch</hi> the uſe of their Factory; and <hi>Caſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broot</hi>
was by the ſame agreement to come and dwell
in it himſelf: But the <hi>Dutch</hi> pretended from time to
time, that when they had made the Factory clean and
fit, then the Admiral would come aſhore to it; and
therefore they had the uſe of what was in it; and
bought Proviſions freely for their Ships: But about
three days before we came thither, the <hi>Kawn</hi> ſeeing
himſelf deluded by them, ſet a great guard about
their Factory, turned the <hi>Dutch</hi> out of it, and ſent
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61112:83"/>
them all off the ſhore. Upon this the <hi>Dutch</hi> thought
themſelves highly affronted; therefore they ſiezed all
the <hi>Perſian</hi> Trankeys or Boats they could catch. And
further, to ſhew the <hi>Perſians</hi> that they could ſtop all
Trade, and ours as well as others, they reſolved to
ſuffer no Boats to come off to us; giving out (as I
have heard ſay) that it was upon Courteſie that they
ſuffered us to Trade, and no body elſe; and hereby
thinking to bring the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſooner to their beck,
and leſſen us in the eſteem of theſe people. Whilſt
I was gone in our Ship to <hi>Ormuze</hi> for Ballaſt, the
<hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> made a new accord thus; That
the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould releaſe all the Trankeys, and then
have free leave to come aſhore with Boats and Men,
and buy proviſions for their Ships as they did former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but the Factory was ſtill guarded, and they not
ſuffered to go into it. And thus it now ſtands between
them, and is the real occaſion of their hindring us as
they did.</p>
            <p>Now if ever the <hi>Dutch</hi> make a ſtrict War with
theſe people, your Honours may by this little occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſee how they will deal with your Ships, if they
are ſtrong enough; notwithſtanding the Treaty <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine;</hi>
for (as I have told them in the Proteſt) they
keep no Leagues where they ſuit not with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
intereſt.</p>

            <p>This Argument That there can be no peace between
the <hi>Dutch</hi> and their <hi>European</hi> Neighbours in <hi>India,</hi> if
they may obſtruct their Neighbours Trade upon the
Reality or Pretence of a War with any of the Natives,
(as they did at <hi>Perſia</hi>) will appear the ſtronger, If it
be conſidered how eaſie and frequent a thing it is
with the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> to pretend a War upon any
frivolous Occaſion; or to make an Occaſion of War
where they want a Realone, by entring into an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance
with ſome Petty Prince on the Coaſt of <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi>
or the Weſt Coaſt of <hi>Sumatra;</hi> or among ſome
of the Iſlands which naturally afford <hi>Spice</hi> or <hi>Pepper;</hi>
and engage that Prince to quarrel with his Neighbour
Prince where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have a Factory, and make
themſelves preſently Parties in the Quarrel: Thus
they did upon the <hi>Celebes</hi> between the <hi>Buggeſſes</hi> and
<hi>Macaſſars;</hi> In which Quarrel joyning their ſmall Forces
to <hi>Rajah Balacca</hi>'s King of the <hi>Buggeſſes</hi> and the King
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61112:84"/>
of <hi>Buttoon</hi>'s Forces, they overcame the <hi>Macaſſars,</hi> and
then obliged them never to ſuffer the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or any
other <hi>Europeans</hi> to Trade more in their Countreys:
and if they could do this upon ſo conſiderable a King
as the King of <hi>Macaſſar</hi> then was, how much more
eaſily may they do it among thoſe little Princes on the
Coaſt of <hi>Mallabar,</hi> or upon the Weſt Coaſt of <hi>Suma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi>
where the gift of Five or Six Barrels of Powder,
and as many Caſes of Brandy, will do the Feat.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid, they did but Threaten, they did
not Obſtruct the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade at <hi>Perſia:</hi> To which
we anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, They did really Obſtruct the Ship <hi>Bengall,</hi> as
before appears, to the affronting of our King and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in ſight of the <hi>Perſians;</hi> in which they alwayes
took a peculiar Pride in <hi>India.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, They did exceedingly hazard that Ships
whole Voyage, and were the Occaſion of the Deaths
of many Seamen on board that Ship, by the Exceſſive
Toil and Labour they injuriouſly forced them to in
that Extream Heat, for want of Boats.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In probability, They had proceeded to
further Acts of Hoſtility, but that they heard of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships coming into the Gulph, upon
their neceſſary Occaſions; which together would have
made up a Force more than double that of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Fleet in <hi>Gombroone</hi> Road.</p>
            <p>To let the World ſee how little the <hi>States General</hi>
would ſuffer their Subjects in <hi>Europe</hi> to be treated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that manner, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company would treat
their Peaceable Neighbours in <hi>India;</hi> Let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
That when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> formerly blocked up
<hi>Lixboa,</hi> although the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had then a Land Army
in <hi>Portugal,</hi> yet did not the <hi>States</hi> ſend a Fleet thither,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61112:84"/>
not only to Force their Trade; but alſo to take thoſe
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Men of War that attempted to hinder it.</p>
            <p>And when the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> lay before <hi>Dantzick</hi>
with a Fleet of Men of War, and had alſo at the ſame
time Land Forces in thoſe Parts, yet did not the States
ſend a Fleet from <hi>Holland,</hi> and by force open their
Trade there? (as juſtly they might do.)</p>
            <p>Now we ſay, and we appeal to all <hi>European</hi> Nations,
whether we argue rightly or not: That what is unjuſt
in <hi>Europe,</hi> is unjuſt in <hi>India</hi> and all the World over:
And on the contrary, what is juſt in <hi>Europe</hi> is Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
ſo. And that Action of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
at <hi>Perſia,</hi> is ſo much the more unjuſt, in regard
it was contrary not only to Natural Right, and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Articles of Peace between the two Nations; but
expreſly againſt that Article in the Treaty Marine of
1674 provided purpoſely to prevent injuries of that
kind, as is well obſerved by Captain <hi>Goldsborough</hi> in
his Proteſt before mentioned.</p>
            <p>To proceed, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have now a War with the
Great Mogull, and a ſuperiour force of Shipping and
Soldiers (by reaſon of that War) than the <hi>Dutch</hi> have
on that Coaſt in the common Courſe of their Trade.
What then? Do the <hi>Engliſh</hi> endeavour to hinder the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Ships from Loading or Unloading in <hi>Surrat</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or <hi>Swally</hi> Harbour, or from the uſe of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
Boats? No, all Nations know they do not,

and much more where they have the leaſt hopes of
putting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the Trade of any <hi>Pepper</hi> Port,
will manifeſtly appear by what they did on the Coaſt

Mr. Daniel Ackworth, Agent and Council
for the Honourable Engliſh Eaſt-India Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
Affairs there.</head>
                  <p>YOUR Honours of the Fourth of <hi>May</hi> by the
<hi>Scipio,</hi> Arrived the Third <hi>November,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
complyed with your Honours Commands, in
taking the good and wholeſome Advice of Mr. <hi>Charles
Zinzan;</hi> which at that juncture of time, was very
acceptable to us by reaſon of the great Diſputes we
then had with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> about Shipping off <hi>Pepper,</hi>
at <hi>Tanor, Penany,</hi> and <hi>Chittuah;</hi> the two latter pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they had for ſome time before blocked up with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Hoves and other nimble Boats, which rowed to
and fro, impeding the Natives (ſo well as us) from
Shipping off any Goods at the fore-mentioned places;
nor do believe we had been able to have gotten the
<hi>Pepper</hi> from <hi>Penany,</hi> had not the <hi>Scipio</hi> touched there;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61112:85"/>
Yet for all that the <hi>Dutch</hi> hindred us to their Powers,
by underhand dealings with the Third <hi>Rajah, &amp;c.</hi>
by Bribes; which ſo far prevailed, that we could not
get leave to ſhip off any Goods, until Mr. <hi>Thomas
Mitchel</hi> went and made our grievances known to the
<hi>Samorine</hi> and Second <hi>Rajah,</hi> telling them of the ill
conſequence which uſually followed, if they ſuffered
the <hi>Dutch</hi> to block up their Ports in this Nature; and
that we came only as Merchants to trade in their
Country, and not to diſpoſſeſs Princes as the <hi>Dutch</hi>
did; (which the King of <hi>Cochin</hi> hath woful experience
of, being no better than their Slave) With theſe and
many other Arguments did at laſt ſo much prevail
with the <hi>Samorine,</hi> as he gave us an Order to Ship on
Board what <hi>Pepper</hi> we had in readineſs; but withal
deſired us, not to carry the Ship to <hi>Chittuah;</hi> for, what
Goods we had there, he would take care of; and when
we were gone, would contrive means whereby to
carry it to <hi>Callicut.</hi> Upon which condition, with the
advice of Mr. <hi>Zinzan,</hi> brought the Ship to <hi>Callicut;</hi>
where and at <hi>Tellichery,</hi> compleated her's and <hi>Succeſſe</hi>'s
loading therewith; having taken out of the former
one Cheſt Treaſure only, and of the latter one Cheſt
Treaſure, and Fifty Piggs of <hi>Lead,</hi> which we adviſed
the Honourable Preſident, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Soon after this the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morine</hi>
complyed with his promiſe, by giving us Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of bringing our Goods from <hi>Chittuah</hi> by
ſending for the <hi>Dutch</hi> which lay at the Rivers Mouth
to <hi>Penany,</hi> pretending earneſt buſineſs, and how deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
he was of keeping a fair Correſpondence with
them. Upon which they all came aſhore, thinking to
have compleated their deſigns at once. But the <hi>Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
ſoon put a Guard over them, pretending that they
might not by any means go on Board before he had
ſpoken with them; and ſo put them off for ſeveral
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61112:86"/>
daies. In the mean time we ſent our Boats, (which
lay ready for that purpoſe) and brought away all our
<hi>Pepper</hi> and <hi>Caſſia Lignum</hi> we had ready. When the
<hi>Samorine</hi> heard that we had compleated our buſineſs,
he ſent to the Dutch and told them, that they might
now go about their's; which they did without any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
from him. At the which the Dutch were high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affronted, and immediately withdrew their Factory
from thence; and now give out, that they intend to
declare Wars againſt the <hi>Samorine;</hi> who lyes ready
with a conſiderable force to receive them, what the
event of it will be, God knows.</p>

                  <head>Extract of another Letter from Daniel Ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth
at Tellicherry. Dated the 9th. of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,
1683.</head>
                  <p>THE Dutch being now Maſters of <hi>Bantam,</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
will be a great impediment to the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Companies inveſtments here upon the <hi>Mallabar</hi>
Coaſt; they not ſticking to give out, that it ſhall
coſt them a fall if they are not alſo Maſters of all this
Coaſt. For, ſetting aſide <hi>Callicut</hi> and <hi>Tanor,</hi> (two
places where the Honourable Company have Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries)
all the Coaſt along to the Southward of theſe
two fore-mentioned places, they tell us it belongs to
them, (though it be no ſuch thing) &amp; that for the future
if we make any Contract with the <hi>Merchants</hi> to the
Southward for <hi>Pepper</hi> or <hi>Caſſia Lignum;</hi> that after
ſuch time as we have bought and paid for Ditto goods,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61112:86"/>
that we ſhall not bring them away. Now it is moſt
certain they will not ſtick to do it, by what they have
done this year; for at a place called <hi>Chittoa</hi> which is
about Twelve Leagues to the Southward of <hi>Callicut,</hi>
we had bought One hundred Tons of <hi>Pepper,</hi> beſides
a conſiderable quantity of <hi>Caſſia Lignum,</hi> on the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Companies Account: And by reaſon the
<hi>Samorine</hi> was not willing we ſhould carry one of our
Ships to the fore-mentioned place to take in Ditto
Goods, we ſent down ſeveral ſmall Veſſels to <hi>Chittoa,</hi>
to bring the goods from thence. Now the firſt ſmall
Veſſel which was ſent on Ditto Account, belonged to
one Mr. <hi>Cracroft</hi> and my ſelf: Now after ſuch time as
they had Laden on board her what <hi>Pepper</hi> and <hi>Caſſia
Lignum,</hi> ſhe could conveniently carry of the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Companies; after they had weighed Anchor
and were coming out of <hi>Chittoa</hi> River, there lying
three Dutch Veſſels at the Rivers mouth, they hal'd
her and asked who ſhe belong'd to? Mr. <hi>Cracroft</hi> (one
of the Honourable Companies Factors) being in the
Veſſel, made anſwer and told them, ſhe belonged to
the Engliſh, and that ſhe was laden with the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Companies goods: the Dutch made anſwer and
told Mr. <hi>Cracroft,</hi> that they had an Order from the
governour of <hi>Cochin</hi> not to let any Veſſel paſs that
was loaden with <hi>Pepper</hi> and <hi>Caſſia Lignum;</hi> and if
they offered to come out of the River that they would
take her. With this (the Dutch having three Veſſels
to their one) they were forced to put into the River
again and unlade her; though according to the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Peace, they ought not to moleſt nor hinder the
Honourable Company in their Trading here in <hi>India;</hi>
yet for all this (provided they can advance their own
intereſt) they neither value the breaking of the peace,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61112:87"/>
nor what dammage they do to the Honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
There was after this, another ſmall Veſſel,
which was laden from the afore-mentioned Port of
<hi>Chittoa</hi> with <hi>Pepper</hi> and <hi>Caſſia Lignum</hi> of the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Companies; and after ſuch time as they had
brought her out of the River, the Dutch who lay with
their three Veſſels ſome ſmall diſtance from the Rivers
mouth, fired near two hundred Guns and Muskets
at her, it being a wonder that they did not ſink her;
which if they had, would have been a conſiderable
loſs to the Honourable Company. After this manner
do the Dutch abuſe and affront the Honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
which if they do not ſeek ſome remedy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their baſe and Traiterous deſigns, the Dutch will
ſerve them ſuch a trick as they did at <hi>Bantam;</hi> and by
degrees root them totally from that little footing they
have on this Coaſt; and then they have accompliſhed
their deſigns. They are going to make War with the
King of this Countrey; for which reaſon (by relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
they have ſent for more men from <hi>Batavia;</hi>
and all is becauſe he ſuffers the Engliſh to buy <hi>Pepper</hi> in
his Countrey. The Dutch are alſo reſolved, if not by
fair means, then by force to build a Factory in <hi>Chit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toa:</hi>
which if they effect, the Honourable Company
may in a manner bid a farewell to their <hi>Pepper</hi> and
<hi>Caſſia Lignum</hi> Trade on the <hi>Mallabar</hi> Coaſt, it being
the chief place we have to the Southward of <hi>Callicut,</hi>
to buy <hi>Pepper</hi> at; which if once loſt, ſhall not be able
to procure any quantity of <hi>Pepper</hi> or <hi>Caſſia Lignum</hi>
on this Coaſt. The Dutch are reſolved to have a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
here in <hi>Callicut;</hi> which if they effect, there is
no doubt but they will one way or other worm the
Engliſh out hence alſo, there being no truſt to be put
in theſe <hi>Mallabar</hi> Princes, unleſs the Honourable
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61112:87"/>
Company had ſome kind of force in theſe parts, that
they might ſtand ſomewhat in awe of us as they do of
the Dutch. It was our hopes that we who are the
Honourable Companies Servants on this Coaſt, did
run the hazard of our Lives by Sea only by running
amongſt theſe <hi>Mallabar</hi> Pirats, when we are forced to
Sail in ſmall Veſſels from place to place on our Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Maſters buſineſs: But now the Dutch are grown
ſo inſolent, that we are (in a manner) in as great if not
greater, danger of our lives when we meet with
the Dutch at Sea, (which in a manner are rather
worſe then Pirats to us, becauſe we have peace with
them) than theſe <hi>Mallabar</hi> Pyrates are; as plainly
appears by a paſſage which happened ſome few dayes
paſt: For one of the Honourable Companies Factors
was ſent down to the above-mentioned place <hi>Chittoa,</hi>
for to bring up the Honourable Companies <hi>Pepper</hi> and
<hi>Caſſia Lignum;</hi> from whence he was bringing four
ſmall Veſſels laden with ditto goods: Now who ſhould
encounter him but one of the Dutch Veſſels? He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the firſt of the four which came up with him: So
the Dutch ſeeing it was an Engliſh man, and knowing
him to be one of the Honourable Companies Servants;
yet for all this, called to him and bid him come on
board; but he not giving ear to what they ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had the Honourable Companies goods aboard,
and did not know but they would have ſtopt him, had
he adher'd to them; therefore he made the beſt of his
way. The Dutch ſeeing that, fired at leaſt Thirty
Musquets at him, and had certainly killed him had he
not clapt himſelf down betwixt ſome of the Bales of
<hi>Pepper,</hi> having no Arms to reſiſt them. Thus under
the pretence of Peace not onely the Companies Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
who live in theſe parts, but the Honourable
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61112:88"/>
Company themſelves are greatly abuſed and affronted
in being impeded by the perfidious dealings of the
Dutch, contrary to the Articles of Peace made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
His Majeſty and them. It being ſpecified in the
ſaid Articles that the Honourable Company may
Trade in any place whatſoever here in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
without being moleſted.</p>

                  <p>WE have Received a large Declaration from
your Honours, Dated the 3/13th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>
1686. of the State and pretended grounds of the
quarrel between His Majeſty the King of <hi>Gulcondah,</hi>
and the Right Honourable <hi>Netherlands Eaſt-India-Company:</hi>
and you have alſo acquainted us, that
you have taken into your poſſeſſion his Port of
<hi>Metchlepatam:</hi> And becauſe we are ſtrangers to
the particular Cauſes of this Warr, we can ſay
nothing to it, but muſt in part believe your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
report; yet we are not ignorant of your far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſign therein, and we wiſh it may not be
one of your deſigns to overthrow our Right Honoura-Companies
Trade there, as hath been practiſed
already too much, particularly at <hi>Bantam,</hi> and
ſince at <hi>Sumatra</hi> (for which you are ſtill accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table:)
for we have ever obſerved that in all your
Contracts with the Kings and Princes of theſe
Countries (after a forced Compliance) you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61112:91"/>
to exclude us Trade in their Ports: which
general deſign your Honours may be well aſſured
is now diſcovered and much reſented in <hi>Europe;</hi>
and thanks be to God we have a King that will
not put up ſuch diſhonours and injuries to our
Nation; and we muſt tell you, that 'tis too great
for you to appoint us what we have to do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reference
to our Trade at <hi>Metchlepatam</hi> (though you
have poſſeſſion thereof) and to reſtrain us therein;
for we know of no obligation to obſerve ſuch directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the houſe and ground of our Factory being our
Right Honourable Companies inheritance, bought
with their money: As alſo our Concerns to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
amount and therefore you had beſt act with
diſcretion and juſtice; for we muſt take notice of
your proceedings in any thing to our prejudice, and
adviſe thereof to His Royal Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain;</hi>
who undoubtedly will take due ſatisfaction. In the
mean time we ſhall endeavour to follow our Trade,
and we ſhall not want them that are appointed to give
us an account of the leaſt obſtruction therein; which
we adviſe you not to do, becauſe of the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
that may be to your own intereſt: for we
would in all things preſerve a good Friendſhip with
you; provided 'tis not to the diſhonour and prejudice
of our King, Countrey and Company.</p>
                  <p>We ſend theſe by Captain <hi>James Leſly</hi> with order to
deliver it to your Honours, deſiring it may be Freindly
Received, as our anſwer to your aforeſaid Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

            <p>The Time they did this was while the King of
<hi>Gulcondah</hi> (in whoſe Dominions <hi>Metchlepatam</hi> is)
was engaged in a dangerous War with the Great
<hi>Mogul,</hi> and they took that Advantage to fall out with
him; and after they had got from him the value of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Sixty Thouſand Pound Sterling, with enlargement
of their Priviledges at <hi>Pollicatt,</hi> they quitted the place,
having no further uſe of it. And indeed the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Company at the time they preſented the aforeſaid
Tranſcript, humbly acquainted His Majeſty with their
Opinion, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> would not hold that place, it
being not worth their Charge to defend it, having
<hi>Pollicat</hi> ſo near that would do their buſineſs as well.
But that which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> complain of, is the inſolent
injury of commanding them from their own Poſſeſſion,
which they had enjoy'd about Eighty Years; which is
the very ſame thing they did at <hi>Bantam;</hi> but intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to keep that place for ever (as they did not <hi>Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chlepetam</hi>)
they uſed the Name of the Young King in
the former Caſe, that it might look like his Act and
not theirs. And whether the <hi>Dutch</hi> did well in that,
or the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had cauſe to complain, We would have
any honeſt peaceable <hi>Dutchman</hi> tell us, after we have
asked them, How they would like it? If the <hi>French</hi>
now they have (as is ſuppoſed) command of the Forts
at <hi>Syam,</hi> ſhould forbid them to Trade to the Houſe
they have built there; Or, How they would have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
it, if our Soldiers after they had ſurprized the
Fort at <hi>Hughly</hi> in <hi>Bengall,</hi> ſhould have forbid them
Trading any more at their own Houſe in <hi>Hughly,</hi> or
from bringing any Goods thither after Six or Eight
Weeks, as they did the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Metchlepatam?</hi> The
<hi>Dutch</hi> Company talk much of Natural Right and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
but there is one ſhort Rule if they would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61112:92"/>
it, would ſoon end all our differences, That is,
<hi>Of doing as they would be done unto.</hi> But that, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Company affirm, they never did yet to them;
which they may have time to repent when they find
the ſame meaſure meted to themſelves.</p>
            <p>As to the Caſe of <hi>Batam Capaſs</hi> (which is a moſt
Egregious Caſe as the Reader will obſerve hereafter;)
The <hi>Dutch</hi> Company would extenuate the Hoſtilities
executed upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, in ſo contemptuous
a manner by pretending a Title to all the Trade of the
Weſt Coaſt of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> by virtue of private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
made with the reſpective Soveraign Kings or
Rajahs, for all the <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Pepper</hi> within their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Dominions: An old Claim which they long
ſince made as well in the time of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as ſince His late Majeſties Happy Reſtauration;
but with how little Juſtice the Reader may partly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
by Doctor <hi>Turner,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Thomſon</hi>'s
Certificate, Two of the Arbitrators that determined
the Differences between the two Companies at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding

Company to join with the Arbitrators choſen by the
<hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Company, to end all matters in
difference between the ſaid Companies, Do certifie,
That the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi> Company did Demand of
the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Company ſatisfaction for a
quantity of <hi>Pepper</hi> taken out of the Ship <hi>Endymion,</hi> by
the <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Company at <hi>Padognae</hi> on the
Weſt Coaſt of <hi>Sumatra</hi> in the Year 1649. And that
the ſaid Arbitrators on behalf of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61112:92"/>
did declare, that it was one of the cleareſt Demands
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company; And
that in the Eighty Five Thouſand Pound awarded by us
and the other Arbitrators, to be paid by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
unto the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> It was (amongſt other things)
for ſatisfaction for the <hi>Pepper</hi> taken out of the ſaid Ship

                  <p>And farther, That the Arbitrators on behalf of the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Company did then propoſe a Clauſe in the
Draught of the award then drawn up, for excluding
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from Trade and Commerce on the Weſt
Coaſt of <hi>Sumatra</hi> for the time to come; The which
was wholly rejected by the Arbitrators for the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Company, and was thereupon left out of the ſaid
Award; for that it was inſiſted upon by the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
for the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi> Company, That they
were as free to Trade with all the Governments and
Natives of <hi>India,</hi> as the <hi>Dutch;</hi> all which is very well

            <head>So much for the Fact, now for the Reaſons.</head>
            <p>I. IS it not moſt ridiculous that the <hi>Dutch</hi> having
but Two or Three inconſiderable Forts (as is
before-mentioned) ſhould pretend to the Trade of a
vaſt Iſland, upon which it may reaſonably be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
there are about One Hundred Sovereign Kings,
one half whereof (in probability) ſcarce ever ſpoke
with any <hi>Dutchman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. If they have made any ſuch Contracts, they are
of no force to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company, who are no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to the ſaid Contracts, whatever they may be to
the Princes themſelves; but by Natural Right the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Company is alwayes at Liberty, when ever ſuch
Contracted Princes grow weary of the <hi>Dutch</hi> by their
bad or non-performance with them; and if the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Company do make another Contract, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the Soveraign Prince of the place, build a Fort
in his Dominions, where the <hi>Dutch</hi> have no occupan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and the <hi>Dutch</hi> do after that, hire the <hi>Mallayes</hi>
to murther the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or do deſtroy or rob them, or
deſtroy their Fort themſelves: We appeal to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Whether ſuch Acts of Hoſtility are not a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
willful breach of the Peace between the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and a pregnant Violation of Common Right?
And whether this be the true State of the Caſe, let
the Reader judge by the following Extract of Mr.
<hi>Samuel Potts</hi> his Letter of 23<hi>d. September</hi> 1686. from
<hi>Indrapoura,</hi> and his <hi>Proteſt</hi> of the 31<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July.</hi> But

            <p>AND as for my proceeding thither, the 16<hi>th.
July</hi> departed hence with what Soldiers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
I thought convenient, to carry along with me to
the Number of Forty, with whom I went down to
the <hi>Qualla</hi> of <hi>Indrapoura,</hi> where I found <hi>Orran Caq

<hi>Mauduta,</hi> to the Number of about Four Hundred,
who were then going to pay their Reſpects to the
<hi>Manumcabbo</hi> his two Sons <hi>Ampitwan Doa Sella;</hi> and
ſo accompanied me to <hi>Batan Capaſs;</hi> and having
then three Sloops in the Road, did order them to meet
me, and make the beſt of their way thither, for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
carrying on of our ſettlement there; My ſelf ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forward by Land towards the Emperours Sons,
who waited our coming at <hi>Pangaſon;</hi> and from thence
we proceeded to <hi>Batan Capaſs</hi> with the Princes and
<hi>Mandareenes, &amp;c.</hi> of <hi>Banda Sapeula</hi> to the Number of
above Two Thouſand: And in Five Dayes time arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with me at <hi>Batan Capaſs,</hi> and ordered me to
ſettle where I thought moſt convenient, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Dutch were come to ſettle there, and had pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
themſelves on the other ſide the River three
Dayes before upon a ſmall Rock, and were very buſie
to fence themſelves againſt any Enemy that ſhould
oppoſe them. Notwithſtanding the Emperour and
<hi>Mandereenes</hi> ordered them to withdraw, declaring to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61112:94"/>
them that the Countrey was given by them to His
Majeſty the King of <hi>England,</hi> for the uſe of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India</hi> Company, and that the
<hi>Dutch</hi> never had had any ſuch grant from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of <hi>Mamuncabbo</hi> for their Reſidence there. The
ſame day we arrived, the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſent us a <hi>Proteſt,</hi> the
Contents whereof was to adviſe us to be careful of the
<hi>Mallayans,</hi> and if they did cut us off, or otherwiſe do
us any harm, we muſt not impute it to them, ſeeing
we were good Friends and at Peace one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
alledging alſo, that we did them great injuſtice
by ſettling at <hi>Bencoolen</hi> and <hi>Indrapoura,</hi> which (as they
ſaid) was formerly given to them. In anſwer to
which, in two dayes after, I returned them another
<hi>Proteſt,</hi> as appears by a Copy of the ſame Dated the
31<hi>ſt. July</hi> 1686. Next having reſolved on a place
which we thought moſt convenient and commodious,
We firſt brought our Guns and Ammunition on ſhoar,
and planted them round our Houſe, which we found
ready put up in the place; and the next day the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
his two Sons, <hi>&amp;c. Mandareens,</hi> did hoiſt up
His Majeſties Flag with their own Hands, and then we
all fell to work for a Pallaſado our ſelves in, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
we did finiſh in few dayes time: The <hi>Dutch</hi>
in the mean time continually uſing their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
both by Night and Day, to fortifie themſelves
ſo ſtrong as they could; to which end they brought two
Sloops into the River, juſt before the place where we
were ſetled; and in the largeſt Sloop the Chief of them
did moſt commonly reſide, having on Board and on
ſhoar with him near One Hundred and Fifty <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
and <hi>Muſtezees,</hi> beſides <hi>Mallayans</hi> and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
In this poſture of Defence we both lay almoſt
Three Weeks; All which time neither ſide did moleſt
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61112:94"/>
each other: Notwithſtanding all the while the <hi>Dutch</hi>
were urgent with their <hi>Mallayans</hi> to ſet upon us;
but ſeeing they would not effect their deſigned ends
by ſuch perſwaſions as they had uſed, withdrew all
their <hi>Mallayans</hi> and moſt part of their <hi>Dutchmen,</hi> about
Three Leagues diſtance to the Northward; intending
(as the Emperour and his People thought) to go further
into the Country, and to deſtroy it, and the Houſes
thereof, but eſpecially the Town of <hi>Battan Capaſs:</hi>
To prevent the ſame, the <hi>Manumcabbo</hi> and his two
Sons withdrew themſelves and their force from me,
excepting about Sixty or Seventy <hi>Mallayans</hi> they left
to keep their Works. The next day after the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
and his force had withdrew themſelves, (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fryday the 20<hi>th Auguſt,</hi> which is conſtantly their
Market day) ſeveral of the Countrey People having
brought Proviſions to ſell, there being a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
number together Buyers and Sellers, with others
fighting of <hi>Cocks,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> took that opportunity in
hopes of making a great ſlaughter, to terrifie the
people, and to diſcourage them from coming near us,
or to bring any Proviſions for us; they fired one of the
biggeſt Guns they had, which was loaden with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
headed ſhot; but miſſing the mark (which I ſuppoſe
they aimed at) luckily, inſtead of hitting the people it
ſtruck againſt a Tree very near to our Paliſadoes, and
there broke in two, one piece whereof was kept to ſhew
the Emperour the other for me when I returned at
Night, being gone that day to accompany the Emperour
at <hi>Battan Capaſs,</hi> with whom (at his requeſt) I left
two <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> and a <hi>Moorman</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
whom they promiſed to protect, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhould be wanting to them; at which the ſaid
<hi>Engliſhmen</hi> were well ſatisfied and continued with
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61112:95"/>
them. The next Morning I ſent Mr. <hi>Samuel Worley</hi>
Serjeant to know the Reaſons why they fired over our
Factory and at our People, and withal to tell the
Chief, that I ſhould ſend the piece to His Majeſty the
King of <hi>England,</hi> and acquaint His Majeſty how they
abuſed His Subjects here: The Chief not being there,
told his Meſſage to an Enſign (that was left there as
Chief until the other returned) who anſwered as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<hi>I wonder you ſhould take ſo much notice of one
or two Shots;</hi> (and pointing with his Finger to a parcel
that lay near him, ſaid he) <hi>We have a great many more
of them:</hi> And accordingly to make his Words good,
the ſame Afternoon <hi>Saturday</hi> the 21<hi>th.</hi> did fire two
ſhots more in the ſame Nature as the others, by which
means our <hi>Mallayans</hi> were ſo terrified, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of thoſe which were left, went away from us;
and they perceiving of it that few were left with us,
the ſame Night by Boats and Prows brought back all
their <hi>Mallayans,</hi> &amp;c. landed them by day light the next
Morning at their own ſettlement, and preſently after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
embarqued themſelves in the ſaid Boats with a
conſiderable quantity of <hi>Dutchmen</hi> along with them,
carrying what force they could make, and ſo landed
them on our ſide with fireing of ſeveral great Guns
from their Sloop, beſide ſmall ſhot, running with all the
force and fury they could, upon thoſe few <hi>Mallayans</hi>
we had left us, who were ſtanding by Three ſmall
Guns without our Pallaſadoes, which they fired, and
ſo run away, the <hi>Dutch</hi> purſuing of them for a ſhort
time, then ſtood and drew up all their <hi>Mallayans</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and returning came upon us, ſtanding at the
entrance of our Pallaſadoes; at which time Mr.
<hi>Mackalon</hi> their Chief called from the other ſide to me,
ſaying Mr. <hi>Potts,</hi> Mr. <hi>Potts,</hi> run away run away, or
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61112:95"/>
elſe the <hi>Mallayans</hi> will kill you, make haſte, be gone:
Yet notwithſtanding all his words of terrour, we were
not affrighted, but only deſired he would give us
time; at which inſtant the <hi>Dutch</hi> forced their <hi>Mallay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
upon us; but they not willing to enter, the aforeſaid
Enſign came in the Head of them, and ruſhing by us
brought in all the <hi>Mallayans</hi> with above Forty <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
in the Rear, forcing them along to enter in; which
accordingly they did, and the <hi>Dutchmen</hi> followed;
which were no ſooner in our Palliſadoes, but ſaid to
me and all the reſt of us, if we did offer to enter in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
we muſt expect to be knockt on the Head. So
preſently after they all fell to plundering, as well the
<hi>Dutch</hi> as the <hi>Mallayans,</hi> and any thing that appeared
ſomewhat of worth, was by them and their Order,
carryed over the Water into their own Fortification,
and delivered into the poſſeſſion of their Chief; as all of
us did plainly ſee with our own Eyes: And I am ſure,
every <hi>Engliſhman</hi> that was there preſent, will ſwear the
ſame. And in the time while they were doing this,
a <hi>Dutchman</hi> went and ſtruck His Majeſty of <hi>England</hi>
His Flagg; and when it was down, the <hi>Dutch</hi> with the
reſt of thoſe they commanded, did in the preſence both
of them and us, and all others there, tear them in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
we not being able to withſtand the ſame, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the multitude they brought along with them;
who did alſo carry away out of our Fortification, all
things of worth and value, into their own; making
havock of the remainder, and afterwards ſet fire to the
Houſes belonging to us: And after all theſe abuſes had
happened, the aforeſaid Enſign with others, by Order
of their Chief, came and deſired me to go on the other
ſide, promiſing me when I ſhould come there, all things
which could be got out of the <hi>Mallayans</hi> Hands, ſhould
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61112:96"/>
be delivered us again; which accordingly I did accept,
and with their Boat went over, where at the Water
ſide Mr. <hi>Mackalon</hi> the Chief did receive me and deſired
me to ſit down while the Water ſerved to go on
Board; and in the mean time would ſee to procure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
from the <hi>Mallayans,</hi> ſo much Merchandize, Goods,
Plate, and other of our things as they could get;
which they were ſo far from performing what they
promiſed, that I having but one ſmall Leather Caſe
wherein I had Two or Three Suits of Cloaths, with
the Honourable Companies Seal, and ſome of their
Caſh; one of my own Servants having got it clear
over the Water where the <hi>Hollanders</hi> reſided; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſat down with it a little while, two <hi>Dutchmen</hi>
came and took it from him, and carryed it into their
Fortification; where after they had cut it open, and
plundered what beſt things were in it, they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it to me again, with ſome few things not
worth the notice. After which, I asked the Chief for
our Goods and Merchandize, Plate and Money, Guns
and Ammunition; This Anſwer Mr. <hi>Mackalon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

Plate and Money, or whatſoever belonging to
the Honourable <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company or their Servants,
it was fallen into the Hands of the <hi>Mallayans,</hi> and they
could not force it from them, the ſame being as free
prize and plunder to them; but for the Guns he would
endeavour to get them again if I would leave one of
our Sloops to bring them away; which accordingly I
did, and promiſed as a reward Twenty Dollers
for the Care and pain of thoſe that ſhould bring them
on Board: But after I was gone from thence, and had
left one ſloop on purpoſe to bring them away; the
Maſter going on ſhore, demanded them of Mr. <hi>Macka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:61112:96"/>
who told him the <hi>Mallayans</hi> would not part
with them under Five Hundred pieces of Eight.
Notwithſtanding the Commander of their Ship
told our Men, they were on board their Sloop
which lay in the River; So our Sloop came
away without them; ſaid <hi>Mackalon</hi> told me

            <p>But the Dutch ſay in their Printed Treatiſe, they
came thither three dayes before us; To which we
anſwer briefly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If they did, it was purpoſely to hinder us;
becauſe they had <hi>Pepper</hi> enough at their own places,
and more then they know what to do with.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If they came firſt, they came wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
becauſe they came with Arms to Erect a Fortreſs
upon the King of <hi>Englands</hi> ground.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If they had any pretence of Right on
that ſide of the River they were on, they might
have ſtayed there peaceably, the Engliſh did not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
them, notwithſtanding they had no right to be
there.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Its manifeſt they had no pretence of
Right, becauſe they did not produce any to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
two Sons while they were preſent upon the
place.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If they had had the juſteſt Title in the
World, they ought not to have uſed Hoſtility; That
being a direct breach of the Treaty <hi>Marine, Anno</hi>
1674-75. by which all dammages done by either Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are to be adjuſted by Commiſſioners in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this going to <hi>Batan Capaſs</hi> of the Dutch, is but
an old practiſe of theirs, to hinder other Nations in
Amity with them. For ſo, when the French Fleet
Arrived in <hi>India</hi> before the War begun, the <hi>Batavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
by Conſultation of the 30th. of <hi>April,</hi> 1672. Sent
preſently to the Iſland of <hi>Banca,</hi> to ſet up the Dutch
Flag there, hoping thereby (as they ſay in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation)
that the French might alter their enterprize,
though they had no Flag there before; and if the Dutch
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61112:99"/>
had done no more at <hi>Batan Capaſs</hi> we ſhould have had
the leſs cauſe to complain, except of their inſatiable
Avarice; but to proceed to Hoſtility as they did at
<hi>Batan Capaſs</hi> is abominable.</p>
            <p>Now to turn the Tables, and ſhew how directly
contrary the Engliſh treated the Dutch at <hi>Pryaman;</hi>
the real truth of that caſe is this: The Engliſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
being expelled from <hi>Bantam</hi> by the Dutch pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
before-mentioned, thought it their bounden
duty to His Majeſty, not tamely to forego all the
<hi>Pepper</hi> Trade, for fear of a little charge, as their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
did the other Spice Trade after the Dutch had
forced them from <hi>Banda, Amboyna,</hi> &amp;c. did ſend an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy
to the Queen of <hi>Atcheen</hi> to ſettle a Trade with
her Subjects for <hi>Pepper,</hi> and built a Fort in her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>But while the ſaid Embaſſadors were at <hi>Atcheen</hi>
on that occaſion, ſome of the <hi>Orran Kays</hi> or Princes
of <hi>Pryaman</hi> and <hi>Teco</hi> came thither on their own accords
unſent for, and applyed themſelves to the ſaid Engliſh
Embaſſadors or Envoys, and acquainted them, that
their Countreys (as the truth is) afforded more <hi>Pepper</hi>
than the Queen of <hi>Atcheen</hi>'s; and the Engliſh ſhould
not onely be wellcome to Trade with them, but to
build a Fort in any part of their Countrey. Upon
which the Engliſh Envoys told the <hi>Oran Kays</hi> of <hi>Pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aman</hi>
and <hi>Teco,</hi> That if they would go to Fort St.
<hi>George,</hi> or ſend thither ſome perſons ſufficiently autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized,
they might better make their Contract with the
Engliſh Preſident and Council there, then with them,
who were but Servants to the ſaid Preſident and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
and accordingly ſome of the ſaid <hi>Oran Kays</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by the reſt did go over to Fort St. <hi>George,</hi> in
an equipage ſuitable to the occaſion, with very many
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61112:99"/>
attandants; and did there make an abſolute Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and conveyed unto His Majeſty for the uſe of
His <hi>Eaſt-India-Company,</hi> the Soveraignty of <hi>Pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aman,</hi>
and as much of the ground thereunto adjoining,
as might be contained within the Ramble of a Shot
from a piece of Ordnance. Whereupon Two or
Three Ships, and Three or Four Sloops were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
prepared and furniſhed with Souldiers; and all
materials neceſſary for a Fortified Settlement.
But a day before the ſaid Ships and Veſſels ſhould
have ſailed for <hi>Pryaman,</hi> the Preſident and Council at
Fort St. <hi>George</hi> Received advice from the King of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coolen,</hi>
that he was willing and extreamly deſirous,
the Engliſh would ſettle and Fortifie in His Countrey.
Upon which after all the Orders were perfected for
<hi>Pryaman,</hi> The Preſident and Council by Poſtſcript or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Fleet and Soldiers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> deſigned thither, to
proceed firſt to <hi>Bencoolen,</hi> being ſuppoſed the windmoſt
Port, and ſettle that place. All this preparation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſo many were concerned, could not be ſo ſecretly
carryed, but that the <hi>Dutch</hi> had notice of it; and
thereupon ſent Eight or Ten Soldiers, and Twenty or
Thirty pitiful black Fellows, to take poſſeſſion of <hi>Pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aman;</hi>
who built there a ſmall Booth or <hi>Cajan-houſe,</hi>
landed Five or Six ſmall Guns, and incloſed ſome
Ground with a ſlight Palliſadoe. After which one of
the ſmaller of the Companies Ships coming to <hi>Pryaman,</hi>
upon a Preſumption that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſetled there,
found thoſe few <hi>Dutch</hi> in the poſture before-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Notwithſtanding with Forty or Fifty of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> under the Command of <hi>James Jenifer</hi> ſecond
Mate and Purſer of the ſaid Ship, marched into the
ſaid <hi>Dutch</hi> incloſure as far as their Booth, with their
Arms fixed; and could have taken poſſeſſion of the ſaid
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61112:100"/>
Incloſure with as much eaſe as Ten Men could beat
One; not only becauſe they were much ſtronger, and
were within the <hi>Dutch</hi> Guns; But alſo becauſe the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers themſelves (ſuch as they were being
moſt Blacks) came to them and told them they had no
Shot in their Guns or ſmall Arms: And that if they
came to take the place, deſired them they would ſhoot
no Bullets as they were reſolved not to do themſelves,
but to ſubmit to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Notwithſtanding which,
and the previous Right before mentioned, which the
King of <hi>England</hi> hath to that place; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having drank His Majeſty the King of <hi>England</hi>'s
Health, with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s, the <hi>States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>'s,
and the two Companies) left the place peaceably,
telling the Chief they had no Order to make War, but
to leave the Right of that place to be determined elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
which ought to be by Commiſſioners on both
ſides in <hi>Europe</hi> according to the Treaty of 1674-75.</p>
            <p>But one Circumſtance is fit to be added, <hi>viz.</hi> In
treating with the <hi>Oran Kayes</hi> aforeſaid at <hi>Fort St.
George,</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Preſident asked them ſeriouſly
whether they were under any Obligation to the <hi>Dutch?</hi>
Which they poſitively denyed, aſſuring the Preſident,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the <hi>Dutch</hi> had no Reſidence in their Country,
not ſo much as a Factory, Houſe, or Lodge; as was
moſt true at that time: And for further certainty of
their Allegiance to His Majeſty ſaid, If there were any
ſcattering <hi>Dutchmen</hi> in their Countrey they would cut
their Throats before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came thither. But
the Preſident told them, That would be an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Act in the ſight of the true God whom they Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
(being <hi>Mahometans;</hi>) and that the <hi>Dutch</hi>
were the Companies Friends and Chriſtians, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he would have nothing to do with them if they
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61112:100"/>
offered any violence or hurt to any <hi>Dutchman</hi> that
might be in their Countrey upon any occaſion. And
this is the very Truth and the whole Caſe of <hi>Pryaman</hi>
as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do a vouch upon their Faith and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to God and His Majeſty, to their Knowledge or
Belief. And how contrary this is to the <hi>Dutch</hi> practice
in all times, any indifferent Reader of any Nation will
eaſily judge.</p>

entred within the Gate) met them, and askt whether

the <hi>Dutch</hi> Soldiers whiſpered the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the Ear,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61112:101"/>

denying, ſaid he had no Order to begin a War.</p>

of the <hi>Mallayes</hi> Natives of the Iſland of <hi>Sumatra</hi> who
were of the number of thoſe that aſſaulted the Sloop
as aforeſaid, by having found ſome Armes on Board
the Ship which belonged to them. And Mr. <hi>Ord</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
them with lighted Matches betwixt their Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
They confeſſed that they were employed by
the Chief of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Factory reſiding at <hi>Padang:</hi>
And that they were to receive Ten Dollars each
Man for deſtroying the People in that Sloop: And
that there were about Fifty Men that came upon
that Deſign. Theſe <hi>Mallays</hi> that ſo entred the Sloop,
took away ſome of the Companies Goods that
were in the Sloop, and ſome quantity of Sword-Blades:
But this Deponent believes they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of being ſurprized aboard, and therefore did
not take ſo many of the Goods as they might have
done: And he further faith, That it is the common
Diſcourſe of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> that they will for
the future have all the <hi>Pepper</hi> Trade to themſelves;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61112:102"/>
and therefore they do cauſe theſe Outrages to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
(as this Deponent verily believes) to hinder
and frighten away other Nations from adventuring to
have any ſhare in that Trade.</p>

Six Hundred Thouſand Rix Dollars; and ſo if they

Thouſand Pound <hi>Sterling;</hi> and many more ſuch

being not quite out of their Debt in 1672. Their
Cuſtom being, when they beat any <hi>Indian</hi> King from
his own Coaſt, make a War upon him, or build a
Fortreſs by his own conſent, or betray him into a
War (for their own ends) to his utter ruine, To
make ſuch King Debtor not only for all the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
(according to a large Eſtimate they accuſtomarily
make of them) but for every Man that dies or is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the Service, Whites at Thirty Pounds <hi>per</hi> Head,
Blacks at Twenty Pounds, as we have heard; but

            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 40. They ſay the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> wrote to
the Governour of <hi>Batavia</hi> not to conſent to withdraw
their Forces and forſake him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we verily
believe he did, and durſt never do otherwiſe, ſince

very thankful Letters for his and <hi>Spillman</hi>'s kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

made it their buſineſs, to entice away their Men in
<hi>Bengall.</hi> The Truth whereof is plainly this; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
of Ships, <hi>Dutch</hi> as well as <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when they
want Seamen in <hi>India</hi> by reaſon of Deaths or Runa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,

by entertaining any Seamen that willingly proffer
themſelves to ſervice, and when ſuch men are on
Board Ships on either ſide, the deficient Commanders
are willing to hide or keep them: But we ſay, the
<hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Company is very much more to
blame for that Practice, becauſe ſome of their Chiefs
on ſhoar have avowed the doing thereof, which we do
not remember that ever the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chiefs did, either

ſaith, That on or about the 28<hi>th October</hi> made his
Application to Seigniour <hi>Willowbutts</hi> the reputed

            <p>Page 47. The <hi>Dutch</hi> would extenuate the injuries
done to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Macaſſar,</hi> by ſaying, they
were done before the Peace could be known in <hi>India;</hi>
(which is not improbable) but moſt certainly that
action at <hi>Macaſſar</hi> was done after the ratification of
the Peace at <hi>Bredah,</hi> 1667. And if the Peace ſince
concluded, <hi>viz.</hi> that of 1674. ſhould cut off the
Engliſh Companies right to demand ſatisfaction for
the wrongs and injuries ſuffered there, (which is not
granted) by the burning of their Factory, carrying
away their goods, and their Servants Priſoners to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia</hi>
(where ſome of them dyed through hard uſage)
why ſhould all this hinder the Engliſh <hi>East-India-Company,</hi>
or any other <hi>Europeans</hi> from Trading with
ſuch of the Soveraign Kings of <hi>Macaſſar</hi> as never
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61112:105"/>
were ſubdued, or have ſince caſt off their ſubjection
to the Dutch; and are now (or lately were) in open
Hoſtility againſt them, as well as in the full exerciſe
of their own Soveraign Authority?</p>
            <p>Secondly, If it were not evidently the Dutch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
deſign to exclude all Nations from <hi>Trade,</hi> why
ſhould they in thoſe Articles of <hi>Macaſſar</hi> exclude the
<hi>Portugueez</hi> with whom they were then in Amity?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We verily believe, it will not be hard to
prove (when this matter falls under a ſerious debate.)
That the Dutch Companies War againſt the <hi>Macaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars,</hi>
was purpoſly made to drive the Engliſh from
that place; The Dutch Company having long endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to drive all other <hi>Europeans</hi> from any vicinity
to their ill got darling Spice Trade; And yet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our profeſſed ſincerity, we will not deny
that the Dutch Company have more to ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in this caſe by reaſon of the time it happened to
be done in, than they can pretend in any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Caſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 48. The Dutch Company ſay, The Engliſh
Deputies in their reply did calumniate the Dutch
Companies conduct, after ſo odious a manner, that
the Engliſh Commiſſioners (meaning the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
Deciſors) were conſtrained to abhor and
manifeſt their diſcontent thereof.</p>
            <p>To which we ſay, Their Lordſhips are able to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
their own honour, which is better approved and
known to the World than to be impaired by the Pen
of any <hi>Dutch</hi> Advocate. And for the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Company, They have now expoſed all their Papers
to the cenſure of the World; not doubting but that
it will appear to all unbiaſſed perſons, they have ſaid
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61112:106"/>
nothing but what becomes them, and is exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant
to truth, and the nature of their oppreſſions:
And if they had ſaid leſs, they had betrayed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of their Soveraign, and their common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as well as the truſt repoſed in them by the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Adventurers.</p>
            <p>Page 49. The <hi>Dutch</hi> demand Thirteen Thouſand
Nine Hundred Pounds for Freight of the four Ships
carrying the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies Goods from <hi>Bantam</hi>
to <hi>Batavia:</hi> To which we ſay,</p>
            <p>Firſt, If the Engliſh Companies goods were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
as to deſerve Thirteen Thouſand Nine Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds, for carrying them from <hi>Bantam</hi> to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia</hi>
(about Twenty Leagues) upon Ships that muſt
have gone thither if they had had no ſuch unfortunate
loadings; How great muſt the Engliſh Companies
dammage be that were at that time the injured Owners
of thoſe goods!</p>
            <p>Secondly, We ſay, That the dammage wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
done to that One injured Ship the <hi>Bengal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant</hi>
in the Gulph of <hi>Perſia,</hi> was much more (in the
judgement of any indifferent Merchant) than all the
Freight of thoſe Four Ships could amount unto, being
bound to go from <hi>Bantam</hi> to <hi>Batavia,</hi> if they had had
no ſuch Loadings on board them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 27. Toward the end of the ſaid Treatiſe they
ſay, However this is undeniable, That our men
now lately at <hi>Bengal</hi> did the Engliſh, a ſignal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
For when they were in a great extremity,
and the <hi>Moors</hi> had deprived them of all means of
Livelihood; Then by our Mediation and Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
the buſineſs was brought to a Ceſſation of
all Acts of Hoſtility for a time: So far was it from
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61112:106"/>
our intent to Plot or Cauſe any harm to come to
them; for if it had been ſo, never fairer opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
was put into the hands of any than in that
buſineſs of <hi>Bengal;</hi> wherein the Engliſh (beſides
the loſs of Hundreds of their Men) would have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
irreparable dammage in their Eſtates and
Occaſions.</p>
            <p>To which we ſay, If we had not been long accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to ſuch ſtrange extravagant aſſertions from
the Dutch Company, we ſhould be aſtoniſhed that
any men in their wits ſhould have the forehead to
offer to the High and Mighty Lords the States General
and Publiſh to the World, ſuch a prodigious and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
untruth. The true Caſe at <hi>Bengal</hi> being really
this; The Engliſh Company had there a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Fleet, Among which Two Ships mounted with
Seventy Two Guns each, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Beaufort</hi> and
the <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and the <hi>Nathaniel</hi> mounted with Fifty
Two Guns; beſides ſeveral ſmaller Ships, and War-Sloops:
On board all which, and with their Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
on Shoar at <hi>Hughly,</hi> they had near Fifteen Hundred
Fighting Men: But notwithſtanding this ſtrength, they
deſigned no War with the <hi>Mogulls</hi> Subjects, if they
could obtain their Right by Treaty; and His Majeſties
Orders, and His <hi>Eaſt-India-Companies</hi> were expreſly,
that if it muſt come to a War, not to begin the War
at <hi>Hughly:</hi> But the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s great Governour at <hi>Decca</hi>
(commonly called the <hi>Nabob</hi>) having ſent down ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Troops of Horſe and Foot to <hi>Hughly,</hi> (of his
ſtanding Army) and they finding their numbers to be
conſiderable, grew inſolent, and pickt a quarrel with
ſome of the Engliſh Souldiers in the Market place or
<hi>Buzar,</hi> and wounded Two or Three of them;
whereof one afterwards dyed. Upon which the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61112:107"/>
Engliſh Captains and Soldiers were ſo enraged, that
notwithſtanding the Orders aforeſaid not to begin the
War at <hi>Hughley;</hi> the Companies Agent and Council
found themſelves under ſome neceſſity to give their
Souldiers leave to revenge their fellow Souldiers Lives,
which they did with ſuch courage that they beat all
the <hi>Nabobs</hi> Souldiers before them like a flock of Sheep:
purſued them to their Mount or Fort, where they
made no conſiderable reſiſtance; took that, diſmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Guns, &amp;c. And while the Engliſh ſouldiers
were ſo far advanced, ſome of the Natives ſet fire to
the <hi>Cajan</hi> Houſes (which will as eaſily burn as thatch
or dry ſticks) thinking thereby (as we ſuppoſe) to
obſtruct the Engliſh Souldiers retreat to their Factory,
which was Fortified with ſome great Guns. The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
killed about an hundred in the fight and might
have killed Thouſands if they would; for after the
firſt or ſecond aſſault, the Natives turn'd their backs
and did not ſo much as look behind them; and might
as eaſily have been deſtroyed as Sheep in a Penn. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
which, in the Evening the Companies War
Sloops came up with the Tide, and fired all night
upon the remainder of the Town: So that never
men could be more miſerable than the unfortunate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Hughly</hi> then were: And all the Dutch
Factors, Souldiers and Seamen, were ſo inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in <hi>Hughly</hi> at that time, that they were as much at
the Engliſh Mercy (and all the Shipping they had then
in the <hi>Ganges</hi>) as the Natives themſelves. In this
miſerable Condition <hi>Abdull Gunny</hi> the <hi>Nabob</hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Hughly,</hi> and others of the beſt of the
Natives, applyed themſelves to the Dutch Chief and
Council to intercede with the Engliſh Agent and
Council for a Ceſſation of Arms, until they could have
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61112:107"/>
Order from the <hi>Nabob</hi> to ſatisfie the Engliſh demands:
which the Engliſh Agent and Council granted at the
Interceſſion of the Dutch; for which they have been
ſince blamed (as they well deſerved) by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Committees in <hi>England.</hi> And it is further
to be obſerved that notwithſtanding the Engliſh
ſtrength at that time and place, and the fury of the
Souldiers; yet the Engliſh were ſo farr from endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to expel the Dutch from <hi>Hughly,</hi> or to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
them Trade after a certain limited time (as the
Dutch did the Engliſh at <hi>Metchelpatam</hi> aforeſaid)
that they did not (in the height of their ſucceſs) of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the leaſt affront, or give any unkind word to any
Dutchman. And further, that God Almighty was
ſo pleaſed to bleſs the Engliſh endeavours to recover
their juſt Rights; that in the conflict aforeſaid there
was but one Engliſhman killed: and the Engliſh
Agent Writes, that of about Four Hundred Engliſh
Souldiers he had aſhore, he loſt but Eleven in ſeven
months killed or by any other accident or ſickneſs;
which is an extraordinary thing in that Countrey.
Beſides, it is obſervable, that the Dutch Chief and
Council, when they came to intercede for the Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
aforeſaid, they began their diſcourſe with telling
the Engliſh Agent and Council, they came to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
the great victory God had given them over
their Enemies.</p>
            <p>The Relation is ſo true, that we believe no honeſt
Dutchman (then in <hi>Bengal</hi>) will deny any part of it;
and it is impoſſible but it ſhould be known to the
Dutch Company in <hi>Holland</hi> before the ſaid Treatiſe
was Writ; ſince by their own Ships the Engliſh
Company Received a Letter from <hi>Abdull Gunny,</hi> the
Native Governour at <hi>Hughly,</hi> Writ in <hi>Portugueez,</hi>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:61112:108"/>
and (as we ſuppoſe) by advice of the Dutch Chief and
Council, becauſe that Letter was carefully ſent the
Engliſh Governour from <hi>Holland</hi> by one of the moſt
conſiderable of the Dutch <hi>Bewinthebbers</hi> (or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee-Men.)
In which, <hi>Abdull Gunny</hi> Writes the
Engliſh Company here, that the Natives had ſuffered
by fire and plunder of the Engliſh Souldiers above
Ten Millions, (we ſuppoſe he means of <hi>Rupees</hi> the
loweſt ſpecies of Money there, which may amount to
about One Million of pounds <hi>Sterling</hi>) and beſeeches
the Company moſt earneſtly for Gods ſake, and for
the ſake of Religion that they would find a way to
compoſe thoſe differences; which latter expreſſion is
not the uſual ſtile of thoſe people, and therefore we
conclude, was dictated by ſome <hi>European</hi> as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
            <p>If the Truth of the aforeſaid Relation needed any

as followeth; That in the year 1686. divers
Ships Arrived in the Bay of <hi>Bengal</hi> from <hi>England;</hi>
that they brought Souldiers, and Military Proviſions,
and withal Inſtructions to the Companies Agent and
Council there to make War againſt the great <hi>Mogul</hi>
and his ſubjects, in Caſe they could not obtain repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and ſatisfaction for the many oppreſſions, charges
and dammages, the Honourable Engliſh Company had
ſuſtained in <hi>Bengal</hi> by the <hi>Nabob,</hi> and his under-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
for divers years paſt during the interloping
times.</p>
                  <p>The Ships which ſo Arrived, were the <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and
<hi>Beaufort</hi> of Seven Hundred Tons each and upwards,
and about Seventy Guns each, and new Ships; and
the <hi>Nathaniel</hi> of Five Hundred Tons Burthen and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and about Fifty Guns, the <hi>Joſia</hi> of Six Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Tons, and Thirty Six Guns, the new <hi>Diamond
Frigat,</hi> and Ten other Countrey Ships belonging to
the Engliſh, beſides Sloops well Mann'd and of good
Force, and about Six Companies of foot Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
                  <p>There was at the ſame time, Dutch Ships and Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boats
in the River not exceeding Ten, but they were
very much inferior to the Engliſh in Burden and
Strength.</p>
                  <p>While divers Meſſages paſſed between <hi>Decca</hi> and
<hi>Hughly,</hi> upon the demands the Engliſh Agent made for
ſatisfaction (it being part of the Inſtructions that fair
means ſhould be firſt uſed,) there fell out an Accident
that unavoidably engaged the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with the Natives;
<hi>Abdul Gunny</hi> Sub-governour of <hi>Hughly,</hi> taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by the time that was ſpent in treating at <hi>Decca,</hi>
had drawn great numbers of Horſe and Foot into and
about <hi>Hughly,</hi> and began by little and little to ſtraigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61112:109"/>
the Engliſh, and abridge the freedom of the <hi>Bazar</hi>
or Market; where he placed many of his new-come
Souldiers; Sometime about the 28th. of <hi>October,</hi> 1686.
The Officers complained to the Agent, that <hi>Abdul
Gunny</hi>'s men had ſet on and wounded two of their
Engliſh Souldiers, as they were buying things in the
<hi>Bazar,</hi> and had carryed them to Priſon in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(where one ſoon died.) The Agent ſent his <hi>Vac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keel</hi>
(a Native in the nature of an Advocate, retained, to
attend the Engliſh Affairs as often as occaſion requir'd)
to demand the priſoners; but he was denyed: The
Agent thereupon, on the Twenty Eighth of <hi>October,</hi>
about Nine in the Morning, did ſend an Engliſh man a
Factor, who could ſpeak the Language, to know of
<hi>Abdul Gunny,</hi> why he impriſoned his Souldiers, and to
demand their Liberty, and ſatisfaction for the wrong
done their perſons. There went about Twenty Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Souldiers, to prevent affronts; but ordered to uſe no
Force, except met with reſiſtance. Within leſs than
half an hour, came an Allarm to the Factory, that the
Engliſh Souldiers had been ſet upon as they went along,
and were engaged in fight with the <hi>Moors;</hi> a party
was ſent out to aſſiſt them, and others to the relief of
theſe; and ſo it continued all day with great ſucceſs
to the Engliſh; for before night, the Engliſh had clear'd
their way before them, where ever they went; they
diſmounted their Field pieces and ſpiked them; had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
about ſixty, &amp; might have eaſily killed many more,
(as the Officers gave in their Report) had they not
been called off upon this occaſion, <hi>viz.</hi> towards the
Evening of that day the fight began, came a Gentleman
from the Dutch Factory of the quality of a Second,
well known to the Agent; he addreſt himſelf in <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueez,</hi>
and the Agent and he carryed on the diſcourſe
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61112:109"/>
in <hi>Portugueez,</hi> and <hi>Dutch;</hi> which this Deponent not
being acquainted with, deſired the Agent to tell it him
in Engliſh, which he did to this Effect, This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(ſays the Agent) comes from <hi>Dutch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary,</hi>
to congratulate the Engliſh for the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
they have had againſt their Enemies, And ſays
that they themſelves had begun, but now the Engliſh
have taken that honour out of their hands. Withal he
told the Agent, that many of the Natives (and I think
the <hi>Phouſdar,</hi> a great Officer in that place) entreated the
Commiſſary to interceed with the Engliſh Agent for
Mercy, (for that there were divers houſes then on fire)
that unleſs the Engliſh Soldiers were ſtayed, they would
burn down the Town, and kill all the People: And
that the Agent would be entreated to forbear, till they
(the Natives) could write to the <hi>Nabob</hi> at <hi>Decca</hi> for
Orders to ſatisfie the Engliſh Demands. The Agent
on this the Dutch Interceſſion, ſtayed the Souldiers
from further killing or plunder that night; though he
cauſed two or three of the Engliſh Veſſels to ply the
Town with ſhooting, to prevent new recruits in the
night, and to awe the place. There was great care
taken by the Agent, that in this broyl the Dutch ſhould
not ſuffer in their perſons or affairs; but ſhould be
uſed with reſpect; and (the Dutch deſiring it) an
Order was given, that no Merchant <hi>Banyan</hi> or other
Native, being in the Dutch ſervice, ſhould be moleſted;
and where their Servants (the Natives) goods were
ſeized, upon aſſurance from the Dutch, that they did
belong to their ſervice, they were preſently reſtored.
And whereas the Engliſh kept a Guard upon the River
to command it, yet all ſuch Boats and Veſſels which did
belong to the Dutch, or did wear their colours, did
freely paſs without ſtop or interruption; though the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61112:110"/>
Rowers, and ſuch who ſailed them were Natives, and
at that time Enemies to the Engliſh. And this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
ſaith, that in all that fight and conflict with the
Natives, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſt but one man, and no more.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Pages</hi> of the aforeſaid Treatiſe beginning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
about the middle of the Book, (which is of two
parts,) the Reader will obſerve, that the lower num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Pages</hi> we are now at, are in the ſecond part of
the <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Copy. Where in <hi>Page</hi> the 14 and 15.
They ſay, and what concerns <hi>Bencoolen,</hi> it is true,
the Engliſh ſome years paſt, came with their Forces
and poſſeſſed themſelves thereof, under pretext that
the old King of <hi>Bantam</hi> had, during the Civil Wars
(in which he was taken priſoner) granted to them free
Trading and Habitation at <hi>Syllabar;</hi> but being driven
out of the laſt place by the forces of the King that now
reigneth in <hi>Bantam,</hi> they retired to <hi>Bencoolen,</hi> and
built a Fortreſs there; where they yet keep their
abode; and from thence did tranſport and <hi>Wreſt</hi> out
of our hands a very conſiderable part of <hi>Pepper.</hi> We
ſay <hi>Wreſted,</hi> Foraſmuch as it was by Contract with
<hi>Bantam</hi> made over to us, whereby although they
have intruded into what belonged unto us to our great
detriment, yet we will paſs that by as not being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
that ſuch manner of Contracts and Obligations
made with Princes in Thoſe Countreys, where we have
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61112:110"/>
only Lodges or Factories do give us no full Right actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to hinder other Nations for to buy and tranſport
their Commodities; but muſt leave it to the diſpoſal
of him that is Lord and Maſter of thoſe Countries.</p>
            <p>This Confeſſion comes near to the truth, but is not
the whole Truth, (as has been before and will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
be further demonſtrated;) and yet by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
they muſt own not only our Right at <hi>Bencoolen,</hi>
but themſelves in the wrong intirely at <hi>Indrapoura,</hi>
where they had neither Factory, Lodge nor Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
and where the Engliſh had ſettled and fortified
themſelves, not only with the conſent, but to the
great joy, of ſeven Soveraign Kings. And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
will by conſequence, convict them of doing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
and unjuſtly ſeating themſelves at <hi>Pryaman;</hi>
and more eſpecially at <hi>Batan Capaſs,</hi> after thoſe Kings
had ſurrendred their Countrey to His Majeſty, and
came in perſon to avow their doing it to the Dutch-Men
themſelves; and the Dutch Chief then preſent,
did not ſo much as urge for his excuſe any previous
Contract with thoſe Kings, or any defect of Title
thoſe Kings had ſo to Convey their Countrey unto His
Majeſty His Heirs and Succeſſors for the uſe of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
<hi>Eaſt-India-Company,</hi> which doubtleſs he would
have done, if he had known of any ſuch Right or
pretences, which have been ſince invented to excuſe
that villanous act. Beſides, ſuppoſing the pretences
to excuſe that act which are now made in the aforeſaid
Treatiſe were not inventions but realities; ſuch real
grounds or pretences of Contracts, can never juſtifie
the Dutch for uſing force and arms againſt the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
in a time of peace, for matters which its confeſſed
ought by the Treaty of 1674-75. to have been amicably
determined by Commiſſioners on both ſides in <hi>Europe:</hi>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:61112:111"/>
And it is very well known to the Kings Majeſty now
reigning, and all the Honourable Lords then of His
Majeſties moſt Honourable Privy Council, that when
the Engliſh Company had been at the coſt of about
One Hundred Thouſand pounds, for fitting out a
Fleet of three and twenty Sail of great Ships, with
about one thouſand Land Souldiers, and ſome of the
ſaid Fleet were departed, and others advanced on
their Voyage as far as the <hi>Downs;</hi> The Dutch Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
prevailed with his late Majeſty, and the Lords then
Miniſters, to command the Engliſh Company to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
recovering <hi>Bantam</hi> by Arms, upon this very
ground, That by Treaty aforeſaid of 1674-75. ſuch
matters and differences in <hi>India</hi> ought not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by Arms, but by Commiſſioners as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid;
and the diſtinction which the Dutch would
make between the <hi>Maliayans</hi> and their own people,
in doing that miſchief at <hi>Batan Capaſs,</hi> every one
knowes is a diſtinction, without a difference;
thoſe <hi>Mallayans</hi> being their hyred Servants, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Proteſt and Affidavit aforeſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to that buſineſs: For if the Dutch ſhould
be accountable onely for what they do by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Dutchmen, there would be found very few
of them in <hi>India</hi> to be accompted with, beſides
Merchants, Nine Tenth parts of their force in
<hi>India,</hi> ſuch as it is, being by Computation of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
or a mixture of all <hi>European</hi> Nations as
well as Natives, <hi>Macaſſars, Buggeſſes, Ballees,
Turnatteens, Javans, Mallayans, Madagaſcar</hi> Slaves,
<hi>Topaſſes,</hi> or black <hi>Portugueez,</hi> which will ſerve any
Nation for Money.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:61112:111"/>
               <hi>Page</hi> 26. Of the latter Treatiſe they ſay, The
<hi>Netherland</hi>'s Company has with a few inconſiderable
Potentates or Princes made Contracts over a privative
or ſecluſive Traffick of ſome kinds of Wares which
their Countrey did yield, but if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company
ſhould maintain this to be an unlawful thing, they muſt
condemn their own doings, and ſo as it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
ſentence againſt what themſelves have done in
former times, and of which many Examples may be
alledged. Now if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company have made
ſuch Contracts ſometimes without, and ſometimes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with us when we were in a near League, <hi>Anno</hi>
1619. And ſome years following as may be ſeen and
will appear in the publick Teſtimonies, and when the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Company had ſuch Contracts with us together,
then according to their ſentiment it was lawful and
good, But now the <hi>Netherland</hi>'s Company do the ſame
without them as having no Communion or Fellowſhip
with them in the leaſt in the <hi>Indies,</hi> ought they not to
call to memory that in former times the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
had the whole Traffick of the <hi>Caviar</hi> which
<hi>Ruſhland</hi> or <hi>Muſcovy</hi> did yield, and to come yet cloſer
to them have they not made in the <hi>Indies</hi> and yet daily
ſeek to make ſuch Contracts eſpecially on the Coaſt of
<hi>Malabar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which we anſwer with Truth and Impartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That when that Treaty was concluded
between the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> 1619, in the
peaceable Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
in <hi>England</hi> on the <hi>Dutch</hi>'s part by that Worthy
Incomparable Perſon <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> and we believe
with an upright intent in him, and the High and Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Lords States that imployed him in that Negotiation.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61112:112"/>
But how the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company immediately upon the
Concluſion of that Treaty contrary to the Lords States
upright intention turned the uſe of it in ſuch a manner
(as we believe the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company would not have us
remember, though it be upon Record in many Printed
Books) as to ſcrew the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by Force and Fraud, out
of all the Trade of the <hi>Spice Iſlands,</hi> which is of more
Value and Advantage than the whole Trade of <hi>India</hi>
beſides.</p>
            <p>2. To come nearer and cloſe to the Queſtion, We ſay,
it is lawful for the <hi>Dutch</hi> or any Nation to make ſuch
excluſive Contracts, and to ſecure the performance of
ſuch Contracts by a Fort or Factory; But if any
Prince or People having made ſuch Contracts with any
Nation (ſuppoſe the Dutch) and the Dutch do not
build any Fort or Factory in ſuch Princes Countrey,
nor (it may be) come in Seven Years after to buy his
Commodity, or will not pay him for his Commodity
but at lower Rates, or in Truck for worſe Goods, or
for any other Cauſe grow weary of ſuch Contract:
and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> be invited, or come thither purpoſely,
to bargain with him; and by his Conſent, (he being
Lawful Soveraign) do build a Fort or Factory in his
Countrey; We ſay in ſuch caſe, if the Dutch do by
Fraud or hiring of Cut-throats (Black People) or by
open Force endeavour to deſtroy the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or any
other Nation ſo ſettled, ſuch Practice is a violation of
Natural Right, Deſtroyes the Peace eſtabliſhed by
Treaties, and is of the ſame Nature as open War.</p>
            <p>3. To make uſe of the Inſtance mentioned in the
aforeſaid Treatiſe, <hi>Page</hi> 27. True it is the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
had by Contract formerly the ſole Traffick of <hi>Caviar</hi>
in <hi>Ruſhia</hi> by agreement with the Emperour of <hi>Voſco;</hi>
but ſuppoſe (as it happened) the Emperour grew
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61112:112"/>
weary of this Contract with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for any Cauſe
juſt or unjuſt, and that he had ſent for the Dutch and
agreed with them, for all that Commodity for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
We ſay (with ſubmiſſion) in this very caſe it
would have been notoriouſly unjuſt in the ſence of all
Chriſtian Nations for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to have made War
upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> for that ſole Cauſe.</p>
            <p>4. We ſay in Fact, That notwithſtanding the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of making ſuch Contracts, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
attempt to hinder by Arms any Nation from Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with any Company or People whatſoever,
where they had only a Factory, how great ſoever that
Factory were.</p>
            <p>5. We ſay, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> where they have a Fort,
did never attempt to hinder any Nation from Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with any People out of the reach of their own
Guns; much leſs from Trading with any Prince upon
the ſame Iſland or Continent, that had Sovereign Power
in his own Dominions, in whoſe Dominions they had
neither Fort nor Factory.</p>
            <p>6. We ſay the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did never deny the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Refreſhment at any of their Forts; but have often
entertained them, when miſſing the Cape by bad Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they came to St. <hi>Hellena</hi> in great Extremity, and
were relieved in all their wants with the ſame kindneſs
as they could have been by their own Fathers or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
But the <hi>Dutch</hi> have often (though not always)
denyed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company Refreſhment even of
Water, when they have been in great diſtreſs, as
particularly and lately the Ship <hi>Pryaman</hi> at <hi>Porcat</hi>
when there was on Board her many Paſſengers, Men,
Women and Children ready to periſh for want only
of that cheap but neceſſary Refreſhment <hi>Water,</hi> as
appears by Mr. <hi>Thomas Michel</hi>'s and Captain <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkettle</hi>'s
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61112:113"/>
Letters of 5<hi>th. Feb.</hi> 1686-87 wherein the Expreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Cruelty are ſo harſh, that we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to recite them <hi>in terminis,</hi> but the Originals are
ready to be produced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 27. They take upon them to know very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
and ſpecially, what Powers and Authorities
His Majeſty now Reigning (whom God long preſerve)
has granted His preſent Priviledged <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
but they betray their Ignorance therein in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo lame an Accompt of that matter; which for
their better Information, we ſhall aſſure them, there
is no Power or Authority whatſoever to the Exerciſe
of Soveraign Power in <hi>India</hi> under His Majeſty, or
otherwiſe, that was ever granted to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
by their preſent or former <hi>Oct-troy;</hi> but His
Majeſty hath been graciouſly pleaſed to grant the ſame
Powers to His preſent <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company for the
good and benefit of His Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty having obſerved by His great Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that it is impoſſible for His Subjects of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>

<hi>India</hi> againſt the Continual Unwarrantable Deſigns of

which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company have, and may lawfully

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 29. They bring up again that Trifle of an
Argument which hath been bafled a Hundred times in
former Debates; and is fit only to be urged to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Children; their Words are, If then it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61112:113"/>
in us by lawful means to ſeek in one and the
other Countrey, out or beyond <hi>Europe,</hi> to get and
appropriate to our ſelves the Trade thereof: Then
we know not how poſſibly the <hi>Engliſh</hi> can be judg'd
blameleſs conſidering what they have done in <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,
Virginia, New-England,</hi> and elſewhere;
Countreys of that vaſt Extent, that all which the
<hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Company doth poſſeſs in <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
is not to be compared thereunto.</p>
            <p>To which we Reply,</p>
            <p>Firſt, It's confeſſed by all Nations, That all Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
within their own Dominions where they have
Subjects and Exerciſe Soveraign Rights, may make
what Laws they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is acknowledged before in this Anſwer,
and muſt be confeſſed by all Nations; that whatever is
juſt between Nations in Amity in <hi>Europe,</hi> is equally
juſt in both <hi>Indies,</hi> and whatever is unjuſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> is
equally unjuſt in <hi>India:</hi> But it is confeſſed, the King

Mevis,</hi> and other Iſlands in the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi>
in all which His Majeſty juſtly exerciſes plenary Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign

thinks fit for the Government of thoſe places; and ſo
may the <hi>Dutch</hi> do likewiſe in <hi>Batavia, Malacca, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,</hi>
and in other places; but in thoſe, and ſo far on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as they have the full Exerciſe of Soveraign Power,
not the pretence of a Right to the Soveraign Power,
where they have neither Habitation nor Subjects; but
peradventure a piece of Paper ſigned by ſome body
that calls himſelf an <hi>Orankay</hi> or a <hi>Raja,</hi> a dozen or
more of which may be had from abundance of thoſe
poor Men for a ſmall Reward, with what words the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61112:114"/>
Purchaſer pleaſeth to put into thoſe Writings.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We ſay that by the Laws of Nations and
Natural Right and conſent of Nations, no Fort upon a
Paſs, or upon part of an Iſland, where ſome part of
the ſaid Iſland remains under the Soveraignty of the
ſame Prince, can hinder any Nation in Amity with the
Soveraign of that part of the Iſland where the Fort is
built, from Trading with the People on the other
part of the Iſland, or with the Subjects of another
Prince on the ſame Iſland: For Inſtance, St. <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>'s
Iſland in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> is poſſeſt partly by the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and partly by the <hi>French;</hi> each in ſubjection
to their Reſpective Sovereigns: Now we ſay, while
His Majeſty and the <hi>French</hi> King are engaged in
League of Amity, if His Majeſty pleaſeth to admit the
<hi>Dutch</hi> or any other Foreign Nation in Amity with His
Majeſty, to Trade to His part of the Iſland of St.
<hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King cannot by <hi>Jus Gentium</hi>
hinder the <hi>Dutch</hi> from Trading with his Subjects;
(and the like <hi>vice verſa.</hi>) By which Rule it will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appear, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Settlements were juſtly
made according to unexceptionable Natural Right,
and the Laws of all Nations, at <hi>Bencoolen</hi> and <hi>Indra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poura;</hi>
and if the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company do or cauſe to be
done any hurt or dammage to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
it will be an Injurious and Hoſtile Action, as is
likewiſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> Companies hindring the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Ships from watering and refreſhing at <hi>Bantam;</hi> which
they have done ever ſince the ſurprize thereof; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
they have ever ſince pretended that place
is none of theirs, but belongs to the Young King of
<hi>Bantam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:61112:114"/>
               <hi>Page</hi> 31. They ſay, They ſuffered us to refreſh
our Seamen at <hi>Batavia,</hi> and to repair our Ships,
which is very true, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
acknowledge their Juſtice in that reſpect;
and as they never did, ſo they never will fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
them with the ſame kindneſs where ever the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Company have to do: But that which follows
in the ſame <hi>Page,</hi> is as extreamly unkind as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it is untrue, <hi>viz.</hi> That in Caſe the Subjects of
that State ſhould come to requeſt ſuch a thing in the
<hi>Caribees, Barbadoes, Virginia,</hi> or <hi>Jamaica</hi> they
ſhould not be admitted, but rather ſeized and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated.</p>
            <p>Towards the Concluſion of their Treatiſe, they
mention ſome little diſorders committed in <hi>Batavia</hi>
by the <hi>Herbert</hi>'s Sailers, and the Maſter of a free <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Ship called the <hi>Madraſs</hi> at <hi>Cochin,</hi> and of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Andrews</hi> his ſearching a <hi>Moore</hi>'s Ship in that Road;
of which we never heard a Word before we ſaw it in
print in the ſaid Treatiſe; nor give any Credit to, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
we hear from the ſaid Captain <hi>Andrews,</hi> who is a
diſcreet ſober experienced Man, and whom we have
reaſon to believe neither did or would do any thing
but what did conſiſt with Juſtice, or his Duty to His
Majeſty, whoſe Commiſſion he had to take all <hi>Moore</hi>'s
Ships, though it ſeems by the Relation they give of it
themſelves he was ſo civil at their perſwaſion, to leave
that Ship behind him.</p>
            <p>We have now concluded our Reply, and Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions
upon the ſaid Treatiſe; and (we think) made
it appear beyond Contradiction, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> have
done many and great Hoſtile Injuries to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Company, eſpecially ſince the time that with Interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61112:115"/>
the Rebellion of <hi>Bombay</hi> broke forth; which they
thought a proper ſeaſon being expert in that kind of
Wiſdom of knowing the times and ſeaſons. But they
ought to remember there is a double Accompt to be
given for Injuries and Oppreſſion of the Innocent: The
one to God by Repentance, the other to Men by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;
without which they may (not improbably)
bring a greater Judgment upon themſelves than we
wiſh, or their ſagacity can foreſee. Until they do
which, and abandon thoſe falſe Notions of Right,
which their unbounded Avarice hath framed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and which we have proved contrary to Natural
Right, and the Laws of all Nations; They may for
ever <hi>impunè</hi> Rob, Kill, and Deſtroy the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Peace between the Two Nations by
the Treaty in force; which we think are as equal and
juſt as can poſſibly be made or provided, if they were
duly obſerved and obeyed by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company, as
we affirm they have ever moſt exactly been by the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Company.</p>
